# REI Store Sales Specialist Interview Responses

## I. Motivation & Fit for REI

### Why REI? / Why do you want to work for REI?

REI stands apart as a cooperative that genuinely lives its values of making the outdoors accessible to everyone. What draws me to REI is the authentic commitment to outdoor stewardship and the unique member-owned model that returns 70% of profits to members, employees, and environmental causes. As someone who bikes daily in Fort Collins, enjoys rock climbing and skiing, and has built my career around mission-driven organizations, I connect deeply with REI's purpose to "inspire, educate and outfit for a lifetime of outdoor adventure and stewardship."

### What sets REI apart from other retailers?

REI differentiates itself through its cooperative model, 100% satisfaction guarantee, and genuine commitment to outdoor stewardship. Unlike traditional retailers focused solely on profit, REI returns value to members and invests in environmental causes, creating a community around shared outdoor values rather than just transactions. The lifetime membership model and satisfaction guarantee demonstrate REI's long-term commitment to customer relationships, not just individual sales.

### How do you embody REI's mission of "inspiring and enabling a life outside for everyone"?

I embody this mission both personally and professionally. Personally, I'm an active outdoor enthusiast who bikes daily throughout Fort Collins, rock climbs, skis, and mountain bikes. Professionally, I've spent my career creating systems that remove barriers and make opportunities more accessible - whether implementing automation that saves staff time or building partnerships that expand program reach. I believe everyone deserves access to outdoor experiences, and I'm passionate about helping customers find the right gear and knowledge to pursue their adventures safely and confidently.

## II. Customer Service & Sales

### What does good customer service mean to you?

Good customer service means creating genuine connections with people and understanding their unique outdoor goals. It's about listening first to understand what adventure they're planning, then using product knowledge to make recommendations that truly enhance their experience. REI's 100% satisfaction guarantee reflects this philosophy - we're not just selling gear, we're supporting people's outdoor journeys for life. Great service means being a trusted advisor who helps customers make informed decisions they'll be happy with long-term.

### Describe a time you provided excellent customer service.

**Problem:** At Strings Music Festival, we had a patron who was frustrated because they'd purchased tickets for an outdoor concert, but the weather forecast showed potential storms, and they were concerned about their expensive camera equipment.

**Action:** I listened carefully to understand their specific concerns, then worked with them to explore options. I explained our weather policies, helped them understand the covered seating areas, and even connected them with our photography guidelines. When they were still concerned, I worked with my team to arrange a secure storage option for their equipment during the show.

**Result:** The patron attended the concert, enjoyed the performance, and later sent a thank-you note saying our proactive problem-solving made their experience memorable for all the right reasons. They became a season subscriber the following year.

### How would you handle a situation where a customer is asking for something you don't have in stock?

I would first acknowledge their disappointment, then explore alternatives. I'd check if we can order the item for store pickup or direct shipping, look for comparable alternatives we do have in stock, or connect them with other REI locations that might have it. I'd also use this as an opportunity to understand their specific needs - sometimes a different product might actually be a better fit for their intended use. The goal is to solve their underlying need, not just fulfill their initial request.

### How do you approach selling memberships without being overly pushy?

I focus on connecting membership benefits to the customer's specific interests and purchases. For example, if someone is buying a significant amount of gear, I'd show them how the 10% annual reward would quickly pay for the membership fee. I explain it as an investment in their outdoor lifestyle that provides lifetime value - not just the rewards, but also the enhanced return policy, early sale access, and being part of a community that supports outdoor stewardship. I let the value speak for itself rather than applying pressure.

## III. Product Knowledge & Outdoor Passion

### What is your favorite outdoor activity?

My favorite activity is rock climbing because it combines physical challenge, mental problem-solving, and connection with nature. I love how each route presents a unique puzzle that requires both technical skill and creative thinking. Climbing has taught me patience, persistence, and the importance of proper gear - lessons that translate well to helping customers find equipment they can trust for their own adventures.

### How do you stay updated on outdoor gear and trends?

I stay current through personal use and continuous learning. My hands-on experience with climbing, skiing, and biking gives me authentic insights to share with customers. I read industry publications, follow gear reviews, and pay attention to what fellow outdoor enthusiasts are using and recommending. I also believe in learning from colleagues and customers - some of the best product insights come from hearing how gear performs in real-world conditions.

### How would you share your passion for the outdoors with customers?

I share my passion through authentic storytelling and genuine curiosity about their adventures. When helping customers, I might share a relevant experience - like how a particular piece of gear performed on a recent climb or bike ride - but always in service of helping them make better decisions. I ask questions about their goals and experience level, then connect my knowledge to their specific needs. The goal is to inspire confidence and excitement about their upcoming adventures.

## IV. Behavioral & Situational

### Tell me about yourself.

I'm a passionate outdoor enthusiast and operations professional who thrives at the intersection of technical problem-solving and authentic relationship building. My career has been dedicated to creating systems that help mission-driven organizations focus on their impact rather than administrative burdens. Most recently, I've been building automation tools through my consulting firm AIBridgeGap while staying active in Fort Collins' outdoor community through daily bike commuting, rock climbing, and skiing.

What draws me to REI is the opportunity to combine my operational expertise with my genuine passion for the outdoors. I believe the best customer service comes from authentic experience and knowledge, and I'm excited about helping others discover and pursue their outdoor adventures.

### Give me an example of a time you were given a task with little direction.

**Problem:** At BuildStrong Academy, I was asked to "improve participant engagement" but wasn't given specific metrics or methods - just that leadership felt people weren't as connected to the program as they could be.

**Action:** I started by gathering data through surveys and informal conversations with participants to understand their experience. I discovered that many felt overwhelmed by the program structure and weren't sure how to apply what they were learning. I designed a unified CRM system with automated dashboards that helped staff track individual progress and provide more personalized support.

**Result:** Participant engagement increased by 50% over the following year, and staff reported feeling more equipped to support individual needs. The system became a model for other workforce development programs in the region.

### How do you handle stress or working in a fast-paced environment?

I handle stress by staying organized and focusing on clear communication. In my operations roles, I've learned that most stress comes from uncertainty or feeling overwhelmed by competing priorities. I use systems thinking to break complex situations into manageable steps and keep stakeholders informed about progress. During busy periods, I prioritize tasks based on impact and deadlines, and I'm not afraid to ask for help or clarification when needed.

### How do you work in a team environment?

I thrive in collaborative environments where everyone contributes their strengths. In my operations roles, I've learned that the best results come from clear communication, mutual support, and shared accountability. I believe in asking questions when I'm unsure, offering help when I see teammates struggling, and celebrating successes together. I also value different perspectives - some of my best solutions have come from listening to ideas from colleagues with different backgrounds and experiences.

### REI encourages employees to "bring their passionate, authentic self." What does this mean to you?

To me, this means being genuine about what motivates you and using that authenticity to better serve others. My passion for the outdoors isn't just a hobby - it's what drives my understanding of why quality gear matters and how the right equipment can transform someone's outdoor experience. Bringing my authentic self means sharing real experiences, admitting when I don't know something, and connecting with customers based on genuine shared interests rather than just sales techniques.

## V. Closing

### Where do you see yourself in 5 years?

In five years, I see myself having grown within REI's community, potentially in a leadership role where I can help develop other team members and contribute to store operations. I'm interested in how retail is evolving with technology and sustainability, and I'd love to be part of REI's continued innovation in these areas. Ultimately, I want to be someone who has helped countless customers discover their outdoor passions while contributing to REI's mission of making the outdoors accessible to everyone.
