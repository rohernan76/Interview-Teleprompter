# Application Q&A - HNC Approach
What drew me most to HNC was how sharply it understands the quiet burdens that weigh down many nonprofits—especially those led by people of color. Too often, I've seen incredible leaders get buried in the daily grind of figuring out payroll systems, nonprofit registrations, or how to track impact in a way funders understand. These aren't side problems; they're mission blockers. What makes HNC stand out is the precision and humility in its approach: not offering a one-size-fits-all fix, but listening, customizing, and being hands-on with leaders to build systems that fit them.

# Application Q&A - Success in Role
I've spent nearly two decades in nonprofit operations, and what I bring isn't just technical know-how—it's the instinct to innovate when it actually makes people's lives easier. At Strings Music Festival, I built a custom automation solution that reduced reconciliation time by two hours per head per month—roughly $6,200/year in saved labor. I didn't build it for fun; I built it because staff were drowning in inefficiency. That's the lens I bring to ops: find the friction, solve it, and return time to the people doing mission-critical work.

# Application Q&A - Supporting Leaders of Color
I've spent much of my career supporting leaders of color—and being one myself, I understand the unspoken code-switching, the resource gaps, and the constant pressure to prove legitimacy that many of us carry. When I led operations for the Innovation Lab in Northeast Park Hill, I was a Latino nonprofit leader building community trust in a space where nonprofits had come and gone. It meant showing up consistently, listening more than talking, and making space for others' leadership even when it challenged my own assumptions.

# Application Q&A - Superpower
My superpower is purposeful innovation. I don't build flashy systems for the sake of looking modern—I design practical tools that actually make people's work easier. At Strings Music Festival, I created an internal app that replaced two sprawling Google Sheets and a dozen headaches. I've transitioned entire orgs from paper-heavy workflows into clean, cloud-based ecosystems—like when I implemented Zoho One at BuildStrong to unify CRM, project management, and form systems.

# Application Q&A - Workplace Preferences
I thrive in workplaces that are collaborative, mission-driven, and grounded in mutual care. As a leader, I value team dynamics immensely—not just how work gets done, but how people show up for each other. That's why I try to hold one-on-ones in person when I can. It gives me the chance to read between the lines, to ask things like: "Are you okay? Do you need help? Is your work still lighting you up?" On the flip side, I struggle in workplaces that prioritize systems over people, or where culture is treated as a side project instead of the foundation.

Action: I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive data management strategy, implementing a unified CRM system with automated dashboards, designing custom reporting templates, and establishing regular data review sessions with leadership.

Result: Executive leadership gained clear visibility into program performance, secured a 40% increase in grant funding, identified and addressed specific program elements creating barriers, and reduced administrative time spent on reporting by 65%.

# PAR - BuildStrong Academy - Fiscal Sponsorship
Problem: BuildStrong Academy was operating under fiscal sponsorship with the Colorado Nonprofit Development Center (CNDC), which provided essential administrative support but also created limitations for our growth and independence.

Action: I led the complex transition process, developing a comprehensive transition plan, establishing new financial systems and controls, managing legal and administrative requirements for 501(c)(3) status, and maintaining transparent communication with stakeholders.

Result: Achieved independent 501(c)(3) status on schedule while maintaining all program operations, retained 100% of existing funding relationships, established robust financial management systems, and positioned the organization for accelerated growth.

# PAR - Strings Music Festival - Event Operations
Problem: When I joined Strings Music Festival as Director of Operations, the organization was struggling with inefficient event management processes. We managed 150+ annual events across multiple venues using a combination of spreadsheets, paper forms, and email chains.

Action: I led a comprehensive overhaul of our event operations, designing and implementing a centralized event management system, introducing workflow automation using Google Apps Script, and creating standardized processes for event setup, execution, and breakdown.

Result: Increased event capacity by 20% while simultaneously reducing operational costs by 15%, eliminated scheduling conflicts entirely, saved staff approximately 15 hours per week in administrative time, and improved cross-departmental collaboration.

# PAR - Strings Music Festival - Financial Automation
Problem: Strings Music Festival's financial reconciliation process was labor-intensive and error-prone. Six department heads spent approximately two hours each month manually reconciling credit card statements, often with inconsistent coding and documentation.

Action: I built a custom reconciliation app using AI and Google Apps Script that automated the matching of receipts to transactions, designed an intuitive interface that simplified expense categorization, and implemented standardized coding protocols.

Result: Reduced reconciliation time by two hours per department head per month, saving approximately $6,200 annually in labor costs, improved accuracy of financial coding by 90%, and accelerated monthly financial closing process by 3-5 business days.

Result: Program implementation timelines improved by 30%, stakeholder satisfaction increased across all groups, donor confidence was restored, and the operational framework I developed became a model for other USAID programs in the region.

# PAR - USAID - Cross-Cultural Systems
Problem: In my role with the Peace Corps in Paraguay, I encountered a significant disconnect between how U.S.-based program administrators designed operational systems and the realities faced by local communities.

Action: I took initiative to redesign our operational approach, conducting extensive listening sessions with local farmers and community leaders, developing flexible operational frameworks, creating bilingual documentation systems, and advocating with senior leadership for systemic changes.

Result: Program participation increased by 45%, reporting compliance improved from 60% to 95%, sustainability of initiatives dramatically improved with 80% of projects continuing after volunteer departure, and my approach was recognized by country leadership and incorporated into training.

# Technical Background
My technical foundation was strengthened through formal education at CodeCraft School of Technology, where I completed Full Stack Web Development training in 2016. This experience gave me hands-on expertise with MEAN/JS development, enabling me to build custom applications and understand the technical architecture behind operational systems. At BuildStrong Academy, I led the implementation of Zoho One as our unified CRM system, personally configuring custom modules, automated workflows, and reporting dashboards.

# Financial Management Experience
My experience with financial reporting extends beyond basic budgeting to include sophisticated financial management systems. I'm proficient in generating and analyzing key financial statements including Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and Cash Flow Statements. At BuildStrong Academy, I was responsible for managing a $765,000 grant, which required comprehensive financial reporting for funders and auditors while ensuring compliance with both federal and state regulations.

# Leadership Philosophy
I am a thoughtful, values-driven leader who blends operational strategy with cultural empathy—committed to building systems that serve both people and purpose. My leadership is grounded in several core values: Integrity & Respect, Equity & Inclusion, Community-Mindedness, Authenticity, Mission-Driven Leadership, and Operational Excellence with a Human Lens. I'm not just focused on systems and performance—I'm committed to people-first operations, consistently emphasizing culture-building, team development, and thoughtful onboarding/offboarding.

# Training Approach
I have considerable experience in training and developing team members, particularly in process improvements and operational procedures. I appreciate the diversity in learning styles and tailor my teaching methods accordingly. I've embraced innovative approaches to SOP creation, contributing to building intranet systems that house organizational SOPs. I utilize workflow intelligence platforms like Tango for creating step-by-step guides and tools like Loom to record video tutorials that walk team members through processes in real-time.

# Project Management
To manage multiple projects and deadlines effectively, I utilize a combination of project management software and organizational tools to maintain both granular and big-picture focus. I most often use Asana when collaborating with high-performing teams, allowing me to break down projects into tasks, assign responsibilities, and set deadlines. I also incorporate 'on-desk ergonomic' organizers, such as Fluidstance's slope desk whiteboard and flow cards, to manage my time and priorities.
