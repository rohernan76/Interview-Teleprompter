# Tell Me About Yourself

I'm a strategic operations leader who thrives at the intersection of technical problem-solving and authentic relationship building. My career has been dedicated to creating systems that free up mission-driven organizations to focus on their impact rather than administrative burdens.

Most recently at Strings Music Festival, I directed operations for a major regional arts organization where I built custom automation tools that saved thousands in staff time while scaling our event capacity by 20%. What I'm particularly proud of was how these systems empowered our team members to spend less time on reconciliation paperwork and more time on creative programming.

Before that, I led operations for BuildStrong Academy, where I implemented unified data systems that increased participant engagement by 50% through improved training models. My work centered on creating operational frameworks that reflected the lived realities of our diverse community members.

Earlier in my career, I managed operations for an innovation lab in Northeast Park Hill, a historically Black neighborhood in Denver. This experience deeply shaped my approach to leadership—I learned that building community trust requires consistent presence, deep listening, and making space for others' leadership even when it challenges my own assumptions.

What draws me to The HadaNõu Collective is your precision in understanding the quiet burdens that weigh down nonprofits, especially those led by people of color. As someone who has experienced the unspoken code-switching and constant pressure to prove legitimacy that many leaders of color face, I'm passionate about creating operational systems that are both technically sound and culturally responsive.

I believe my combination of technical fluency and people-centered service aligns perfectly with this role. I don't just build systems for efficiency's sake—I design practical tools that actually make people's work easier and return time to the people doing mission-critical work. And I approach leader support with humility, asking the right questions rather than assuming I have all the answers.

I'm excited about the possibility of contributing to HNC's mission of helping nonprofits become more effective at what they do, particularly through the Infrastructure and Leader Support program where I can apply my experience in navigating complex systems so others don't have to.

# Application Q&A

Q1: What is most compelling to you about HNC or our approach?
What drew me most to HNC was how sharply it understands the quiet burdens that weigh down many nonprofits—especially those led by people of color. Too often, I've seen incredible leaders get buried in the daily grind of figuring out payroll systems, nonprofit registrations, or how to track impact in a way funders understand. These aren't side problems; they're mission blockers. What makes HNC stand out is the precision and humility in its approach: not offering a one-size-fits-all fix, but listening, customizing, and being hands-on with leaders to build systems that fit them. That kind of operational accompaniment—grounded in both empathy and expertise—is rare. And for me, it's energizing.

Q2: Why do you believe you would be successful in this role?
I've spent nearly two decades in nonprofit operations, and what I bring isn't just technical know-how—it's the instinct to innovate when it actually makes people's lives easier. At Strings Music Festival, for instance, I was responsible for reconciling monthly credit card statements—painstaking, manual work shared across six department heads. Using AI tools and Google Apps Script, I built a custom automation solution that reduced reconciliation time by two hours per head per month—roughly $6,200/year in saved labor, not to mention the mental load it freed up. I didn't build it for fun (though I enjoy this kind of tinkering); I built it because staff were drowning in inefficiency. That's the lens I bring to ops: find the friction, solve it, and return time to the people doing mission-critical work. HNC's approach to supporting leaders by removing operational barriers? That's exactly where I've spent my career thriving.

Q3: The majority of leaders HNC works with are executive leaders of color, and they often experience unique challenges and barriers as they work to bring their vision to life. Given this, please tell us a bit about why you're the right person to support leaders in navigating this complexity.
I've spent much of my career supporting leaders of color—and being one myself, I understand the unspoken code-switching, the resource gaps, and the constant pressure to prove legitimacy that many of us carry. When I led operations for the Innovation Lab in Northeast Park Hill, a historically Black neighborhood in Denver, I was a Latino nonprofit leader building community trust in a space where nonprofits had come and gone. It meant showing up consistently, listening more than talking, and making space for others' leadership even when it challenged my own assumptions. That experience taught me humility and how to support from behind the scenes. I don't assume I have the answers—I ask the right questions, and I'm not afraid to roll up my sleeves to help leaders execute their vision on their own terms.

Q4: What is your superpower?
My superpower is purposeful innovation. I don't build flashy systems for the sake of looking modern—I design practical tools that actually make people's work easier. At Strings Music Festival, I created an internal app that replaced two sprawling Google Sheets and a dozen headaches. It centralized 150+ events, streamlined scheduling, and brought everything into a mobile format that fit in people's pockets. I've transitioned entire orgs from paper-heavy workflows into clean, cloud-based ecosystems—like when I implemented Zoho One at BuildStrong to unify CRM, project management, and form systems. I was also an early adopter of AI tools (I started using ChatGPT Plus in late 2023) and now routinely build automations that cut down on busywork and increase accuracy. What drives me isn't the cool factor—it's knowing that the time saved lets staff do the real work they were hired for. That's what I'm great at: building elegant fixes to messy problems.

Q5: What kind of workplace do you thrive in? What kind of workplace do you struggle in?
I thrive in workplaces that are collaborative, mission-driven, and grounded in mutual care. As a leader, I value team dynamics immensely—not just how work gets done, but how people show up for each other. Seeing someone bring their full human presence—their spark, humor, curiosity—into a shared space matters to me. That's why I try to hold one-on-ones in person when I can. It gives me the chance to read between the lines, to ask things like: "Are you okay? Do you need help? Is your work still lighting you up? What drives you right now—professionally and personally?" In-person time doesn't need to be constant, but I believe it should be meaningful. And while I fully respect that much of today's work is remote and digital (and I won't try to reverse that tide), I also see it as an invitation to make each real-life interaction count. On the flip side, I struggle in workplaces that prioritize systems over people, or where culture is treated as a side project instead of the foundation. I do my best work in places where people trust one another, celebrate each other, and leave space for both rigor and joy.

# PAR Examples

## BuildStrong Academy

### PAR Example 1: Designing and Scaling Workforce Training Systems

**Problem:** 
As Director of Operations at BuildStrong Academy, I faced the challenge of scaling our workforce development program while maintaining quality and accessibility. Our training systems were largely paper-based, instructor-dependent, and difficult to replicate across locations. This created bottlenecks in enrollment, inconsistent training experiences, and limited our ability to track outcomes effectively. Additionally, we needed to better serve diverse participants, many of whom faced significant barriers to entering the construction industry.

**Action:**
I led a comprehensive redesign of our operational infrastructure:
- Implemented a unified CRM system with automated dashboards that centralized participant data, training progress, and employment outcomes
- Collaborated with instructors to develop standardized curriculum modules that maintained flexibility for different learning styles
- Led the integration of XR/VR tools into our training program, creating immersive learning experiences that improved skill retention
- Developed culturally responsive recruitment and support systems that addressed specific barriers faced by women and people of color
- Created strategic partnerships with employers and community organizations to strengthen our training-to-employment pipeline

**Result:**
The systems transformation yielded significant improvements:
- Increased annual participant engagement by 50% through improved training models and strategic education partnerships
- Boosted program completion rates from 68% to 85% by implementing responsive support systems
- Improved job placement rates by 35% through stronger employer partnerships and better-prepared graduates
- Successfully scaled the program model to multiple locations while maintaining consistent quality
- Significantly increased participation from underrepresented groups in construction (women increased from 12% to 28% of participants)

### PAR Example 2: Data-Driven Operational Leadership

**Problem:**
BuildStrong Academy lacked robust data infrastructure to inform decision-making and demonstrate program impact. Leadership had limited visibility into program performance, funders received inconsistent reporting, and we couldn't effectively identify improvement opportunities. This created challenges in securing additional funding and scaling our impact.

**Action:**
I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive data management strategy:
- Implemented a unified CRM system with automated dashboards that provided real-time insights into program performance
- Designed custom reporting templates that aligned with funder requirements while capturing meaningful impact metrics
- Trained staff on data collection protocols and created user-friendly interfaces that minimized administrative burden
- Established regular data review sessions with leadership to identify trends and improvement opportunities
- Developed participant feedback mechanisms that centered the voices of program participants in our improvement process

**Result:**
This data-driven approach transformed our operations and impact:
- Executive leadership gained clear visibility into program performance, enabling more strategic decision-making
- Secured a 40% increase in grant funding due to our ability to demonstrate measurable impact
- Identified and addressed specific program elements that were creating barriers for certain participant groups
- Reduced administrative time spent on reporting by 65% through automation
- Created a culture of continuous improvement based on data insights and participant feedback

### PAR Example 3: Fiscal Sponsorship Transition Management

**Problem:**
BuildStrong Academy was operating under fiscal sponsorship with the Colorado Nonprofit Development Center (CNDC), which provided essential administrative support but also created limitations for our growth and independence. We needed to transition to an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit while maintaining operational continuity, financial stability, and stakeholder confidence.

**Action:**
I led the complex transition process with meticulous planning and execution:
- Developed a comprehensive transition plan with clear milestones, responsibilities, and risk mitigation strategies
- Established new financial systems and controls, including setting up QuickBooks, creating chart of accounts, and implementing approval workflows
- Managed the legal and administrative requirements for 501(c)(3) status, including board development and governance structures
- Created new HR systems, including benefits administration, payroll processing, and personnel policies
- Maintained transparent communication with staff, funders, and partners throughout the transition

**Result:**
The transition was completed successfully with minimal disruption:
- Achieved independent 501(c)(3) status on schedule while maintaining all program operations
- Retained 100% of existing funding relationships through proactive stakeholder management
- Established robust financial management systems that passed subsequent audit requirements
- Created more efficient administrative processes that reduced overhead costs by 12%
- Positioned the organization for accelerated growth, leading to a 40% expansion in program offerings within the following year

## Strings Music Festival

### PAR Example 1: Optimizing Year-Round Event Operations

**Problem:** 
When I joined Strings Music Festival as Director of Operations, the organization was struggling with inefficient event management processes. We managed 150+ annual events across multiple venues using a combination of spreadsheets, paper forms, and email chains. This fragmented approach led to scheduling conflicts, communication breakdowns between departments, and excessive administrative time spent on basic logistics. Staff were spending hours each week on manual data entry rather than focusing on artistic programming and audience experience.

**Action:**
I led a comprehensive overhaul of our event operations:
- Designed and implemented a centralized event management system that integrated scheduling, staffing, technical requirements, and venue logistics
- Introduced workflow automation using Google Apps Script to streamline team communication and task execution
- Created standardized processes for event setup, execution, and breakdown that could be consistently applied across venues
- Developed mobile-friendly digital tools that put critical information in staff members' pockets rather than in binders at the office
- Facilitated cross-departmental training to ensure all team members could effectively use the new systems

**Result:**
The operational transformation yielded significant improvements:
- Increased event capacity by 20% while simultaneously reducing operational costs by 15%
- Eliminated scheduling conflicts entirely and reduced last-minute logistical issues by 85%
- Saved staff approximately 15 hours per week in administrative time, allowing them to focus on audience experience
- Improved cross-departmental collaboration, with staff reporting higher job satisfaction and reduced stress
- Created scalable systems that allowed us to expand programming to new venues without proportional increases in administrative overhead

### PAR Example 2: Financial Process Automation and Efficiency

**Problem:**
Strings Music Festival's financial reconciliation process was labor-intensive and error-prone. Six department heads spent approximately two hours each month manually reconciling credit card statements, often with inconsistent coding and documentation. This created downstream challenges for accounting, delayed financial reporting, and diverted valuable leadership time from strategic priorities.

**Action:**
I identified this as an opportunity for purposeful innovation:
- Built a custom reconciliation app using AI and Google Apps Script that automated the matching of receipts to transactions
- Designed an intuitive interface that simplified expense categorization and approval workflows
- Implemented standardized coding protocols that ensured consistent financial reporting
- Created automated reminders and follow-ups to ensure timely completion
- Developed comprehensive documentation and training to ensure smooth adoption

**Result:**
This automation initiative delivered measurable impact:
- Reduced reconciliation time by two hours per department head per month, saving approximately $6,200 annually in labor costs
- Improved accuracy of financial coding, reducing accounting corrections by 90%
- Accelerated monthly financial closing process by 3-5 business days
- Increased compliance with documentation requirements from 75% to 98%
- Created a model for identifying and automating other administrative processes throughout the organization

### PAR Example 3: Complex Logistics Management Across Venues

**Problem:**
Strings Music Festival faced significant logistical challenges managing events across multiple venues with different technical requirements, staffing needs, and audience capacities. This complexity was compounded during our summer festival season when we hosted back-to-back events with quick turnarounds. Equipment was frequently misplaced, staffing allocations were inefficient, and setup times were inconsistent.

**Action:**
I developed a comprehensive logistics management system:
- Created detailed venue profiles with standardized setup configurations, equipment inventories, and staffing requirements
- Implemented a digital asset tracking system to monitor the location and status of key equipment
- Developed tiered staffing models based on event type, size, and technical complexity
- Designed visual setup guides and checklists for each venue to ensure consistency
- Established clear communication protocols for last-minute changes and emergency situations

**Result:**
The logistics system dramatically improved our operational efficiency:
- Reduced average setup time by 35% while improving quality and consistency
- Virtually eliminated missing or misplaced equipment issues
- Optimized staffing allocations, reducing overtime costs by 22% while maintaining service quality
- Successfully managed a record number of events during our peak season with fewer logistical issues than previous years
- Received positive feedback from artists and technical staff about the improved organization and professionalism

### PAR Example 4: Vendor Relationship Management and Procurement Optimization

**Problem:**
At Strings Music Festival, our vendor management and procurement processes were decentralized and inefficient. Each department managed their own vendor relationships, resulting in duplicate vendors, inconsistent pricing, and missed opportunities for volume discounts. We lacked standardized procurement procedures, which led to unnecessary rush orders, higher costs, and occasional supply shortages that impacted event quality.

**Action:**
I implemented a strategic vendor management and procurement system:
- Conducted a comprehensive audit of all vendors and consolidated relationships where appropriate
- Negotiated improved terms with key suppliers based on our total organizational spend
- Developed a centralized vendor database with performance ratings, contact information, and contract terms
- Created standardized procurement procedures with appropriate approval workflows and lead times
- Implemented inventory management systems for frequently used supplies to prevent shortages

**Result:**
The new vendor and procurement approach delivered significant benefits:
- Reduced procurement costs by 18% through vendor consolidation and improved negotiation
- Decreased emergency orders by 75%, eliminating rush fees and reducing stress on staff
- Improved vendor performance and responsiveness through consistent relationship management
- Enhanced budget forecasting accuracy with better visibility into upcoming expenses
- Strengthened local community relationships by strategically supporting local vendors where possible

## USAID

### PAR Example 1: Navigating High-Stakes International Operations

**Problem:** 
As a Technical Trainer with USAID in Paraguay, I was tasked with supporting a critical rural development program that was facing significant operational challenges. The program involved multiple stakeholders with competing priorities—local government officials, international donors, and community leaders—each with different expectations and reporting requirements. Communication breakdowns were causing delays in project implementation, and donor confidence was beginning to waver.

**Action:**
I developed a streamlined operational framework that balanced stakeholder needs while maintaining program integrity:
- Created a unified reporting system that satisfied both USAID's rigorous documentation requirements and local partners' need for accessible information
- Established clear communication protocols for all stakeholders, including regular touchpoints and transparent decision-making processes
- Implemented a cultural bridge approach where I actively translated not just language but cultural contexts between international donors and local communities
- Facilitated collaborative problem-solving sessions that gave voice to local leaders while meeting donor requirements

**Result:**
The operational restructuring transformed program effectiveness:
- Program implementation timelines improved by 30%, with all key milestones met on schedule
- Stakeholder satisfaction increased across all groups, with particularly positive feedback from local community leaders who felt genuinely heard
- Donor confidence was restored, leading to continued funding for the initiative
- The operational framework I developed became a model for other USAID programs in the region
- Most importantly, the program was able to refocus on its core mission of rural development rather than administrative challenges

### PAR Example 2: Building Cross-Cultural Operational Systems

**Problem:**
In my role with the Peace Corps in Paraguay, I encountered a significant disconnect between how U.S.-based program administrators designed operational systems and the realities faced by local communities. Standard reporting templates and operational procedures often failed to account for local contexts, creating friction and reducing program effectiveness. This was particularly evident in our agricultural extension work, where rigid implementation guidelines clashed with seasonal farming practices.

**Action:**
I took initiative to redesign our operational approach:
- Conducted extensive listening sessions with local farmers and community leaders to understand their needs, constraints, and traditional practices
- Developed flexible operational frameworks that maintained accountability while respecting local rhythms and practices
- Created bilingual documentation systems that empowered local partners to take ownership of reporting
- Trained both U.S. volunteers and local counterparts on culturally responsive operational practices
- Advocated with senior leadership for systemic changes to program design that centered local knowledge

**Result:**
This culturally responsive approach yielded significant improvements:
- Program participation increased by 45% as local farmers saw their knowledge and practices respected
- Reporting compliance improved from 60% to 95% as local partners took ownership of documentation
- Sustainability of initiatives dramatically improved, with 80% of projects continuing after volunteer departure (compared to previous 40%)
- My approach was recognized by country leadership and incorporated into training for new volunteers
- The experience deeply shaped my understanding of how operational systems must reflect the lived realities of the communities they serve

# Supplemental Experience and Reflections

## Technical Background and Development Experience

My technical foundation was strengthened through formal education at CodeCraft School of Technology, where I completed Full Stack Web Development training in 2016. This experience gave me hands-on expertise with MEAN/JS development, enabling me to build custom applications and understand the technical architecture behind operational systems. This technical knowledge has been invaluable in my approach to operations, allowing me to bridge the gap between user needs and technical solutions.

I've consistently applied this technical expertise throughout my career. At BuildStrong Academy, I led the implementation of Zoho One as our unified CRM system, personally configuring custom modules, automated workflows, and reporting dashboards. This wasn't just a technical implementation—I approached it as a cultural change management project, ensuring staff had the training and support needed to embrace the new systems.

My early adoption of AI tools (starting with ChatGPT Plus in late 2023) has allowed me to stay at the forefront of operational innovation. I now routinely build automations that reduce busywork and increase accuracy, always focusing on practical applications that solve real problems rather than implementing technology for its own sake.

## Financial Management and Reporting Experience

My experience with financial reporting extends beyond basic budgeting to include sophisticated financial management systems. I'm proficient in generating and analyzing key financial statements including Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and Cash Flow Statements. At BuildStrong Academy, I was responsible for managing a $765,000 grant, which required comprehensive financial reporting for funders and auditors while ensuring compliance with both federal and state regulations.

I've worked with various financial and accounting software, including QuickBooks, NetSuite, Microsoft Excel, and Zoho CRM for tracking financial metrics. My approach to financial management always balances rigorous compliance with user-friendly systems that don't create unnecessary administrative burden.

One of my strengths is conducting variance analyses to explain discrepancies between actual and forecasted expenditures, identifying areas for cost savings, and making recommendations to improve organizational financial health. These reports often combine financial metrics with operational data to give leadership a comprehensive view of program performance.

## Leadership Philosophy and Values

I am a thoughtful, values-driven leader who blends operational strategy with cultural empathy—committed to building systems that serve both people and purpose. My leadership is grounded in several core values:

**Integrity & Respect:** I place strong emphasis on treating people with dignity—whether it's a department head, a vendor, or a direct report. I believe respect fosters trust and operational excellence, and I lead with that mindset.

**Equity & Inclusion:** I'm intentional about making space for underrepresented voices, including my own as a first-generation, brown, Latino man. I value inclusive cultures and environments where everyone feels seen and respected.

**Community-Mindedness:** I care deeply about how my work connects to the broader community—whether it's advocating for bike infrastructure or building equitable workforce development systems.

**Authenticity:** I value storytelling, personal connection, and clarity over corporate jargon or fluff. I believe in bringing my full self to my work and creating space for others to do the same.

**Mission-Driven Leadership:** I'm motivated by purpose. The organizations I've worked with and the jobs I pursue are clearly aligned with values like access, sustainability, education, and community building.

**Operational Excellence with a Human Lens:** I'm not just focused on systems and performance—I'm committed to people-first operations. I consistently emphasize culture-building, team development, and thoughtful onboarding/offboarding.

## Training and Knowledge Transfer Approach

I have considerable experience in training and developing team members, particularly in process improvements and operational procedures. I appreciate the diversity in learning styles and tailor my teaching methods accordingly, adjusting not only the teaching materials but also the delivery methods to demonstrate my dedication to others' learning and success.

I've embraced innovative approaches to SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) creation, recognizing that not all SOPs are created equal. I've contributed to building intranet systems that house organizational SOPs, making them easily accessible regardless of the file management ecosystem in use.

I utilize workflow intelligence platforms like Tango for creating step-by-step guides that document processes in detail for those who need granular instructions. For visual learners, I use tools like Loom to record video tutorials that walk team members through processes in real-time, making complex procedures more accessible and easier to follow.

## Project Management and Prioritization

To manage multiple projects and deadlines effectively, I utilize a combination of project management software and organizational tools to maintain both granular and big-picture focus. I most often use Asana when collaborating with high-performing teams, allowing me to break down projects into tasks, assign responsibilities, and set deadlines.

For example, at BuildStrong Academy, I was responsible for overseeing a major construction upgrade while simultaneously managing the installation of EV chargers on campus. I used Asana to manage task assignments, track deadlines, and maintain communication across departments, ensuring both projects moved forward without delay.

In addition to digital tools, I incorporate 'on-desk ergonomic' organizers, such as Fluidstance's slope desk whiteboard and flow cards, to manage my time and priorities. These tools bring my attention to immediate critical needs while serving as visual reminders of long-term goals and project deliverables.

This combination of digital project management tools and physical organizers helps me keep track of multiple deadlines and maintain momentum, even when priorities shift. I credit this success to the systems I've developed, which allow me to stay organized, manage complexity, and keep projects on track.

# ONLINE APPLICATION QUESTIONS
*QUESTION 2: 

How many years of experience do you have in economic, business or community 
development, business support or consulting in a related field? 

 Less than 1 year 

 1 to 3 years 

 3 to 4 years 

 More than 4 years, but less than 5 years 

 5 or more years 

*QUESTION 3:

*QUESTION 4: 

How would you ensure that economic and business service efforts benefit all 
communities in Larimer County? 

To ensure that economic and business service efforts benefit all communities in 
Larimer County, I would focus on creating accessible, inclusive, and community-driven 
initiatives. This begins with active outreach and engagement with diverse community stakeholders, including underrepresented groups, rural residents, and small 
businesses. I would conduct thorough needs assessments to understand the specific 
challenges and opportunities within each community. By leveraging data and community 
input, I would design targeted programs that address the unique economic needs of 
each area. If no such system exists for capturing the data, it is imperative that 
such a system be created. Bringing evidence-based findings and solutions could bring 
a tremendous amount of transparency around ensuring all communities (i.e., targeted 
zip codes, business-related zones, etc.) receive economic and business services. 
Additionally, I would establish feedback loops, such as a Google Form survey, to 
gather consistent feedback from local business owners about their satisfaction and 
service needs, adapting services as community needs evolve. This approach would help 
ensure that the benefits of economic growth reach everyone, regardless of geography 
or socioeconomic status. 

*QUESTION 5: 

What experience do you have where you have fostered collaboration between government, 
business, and community organizations to support sustainable economic growth at a 
local or regional level? 

In my role as Operations Manager at the Colorado Homebuilding Academy, I fostered 
collaboration between multiple stakeholders, including government entities, local 
schools, industry partners, and community organizations. One notable example was my 
leadership in spearheading a collaboration between a nonprofit agency, the 
HomeBuilder Institute (HBI), our primary benefactor Oakwood Homes (the second largest 
private homebuilder in Colorado), the franchise expert 'Franchise for Good,' and the 
Department of Labor. Together, we created a viable, replicable, and working model 
construction trades program, which has now expanded beyond Colorado to include 
Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and Arizona. This collaboration brought together expertise 
and resources from various sectors to create a program that effectively addressed 
workforce needs while ensuring the model could be scaled to benefit other regions. By 
aligning the goals of educators, businesses, and policymakers, we not only addressed 
the construction labor shortage but also provided a pathway for youth to access 
sustainable, high-paying careers. This collaborative approach, which has now expanded 
beyond Colorado to include Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and Arizona, resulted in a 70% 
growth in the program, demonstrating the power of coordinated efforts to drive 
sustainable economic growth. 

*QUESTION 6: 

Please choose one of the Larimer County guiding principles listed that you feel most 
applies to you and this position - Larimer County will add value to the lives of its 
citizens today and in the future by: 

. Being good stewards of public resources. 

. Promoting innovation, adaptability, and committing to continuous improvement. 

. Providing consistent quality customer service. 

. Empowering people to take responsibility. 

. Cultivating inclusive and collaborative partnerships 

. Being a fulfilling, enjoyable, and inclusive place to work. 


*QUESTION 7: 

Based on your choice in the previous question, describe how you would apply this 
guiding principle in this position. 

In the role of Associate Director of Economic Development, I would apply the 
principle of cultivating inclusive and collaborative partnerships by actively 
engaging with a wide range of stakeholders, including community members, local 
businesses, educational institutions, and government entities. My approach would be 
to establish open channels of communication and foster trust among these groups to 
ensure that everyone's voices are heard and valued in the decision-making process. I 
would also focus on bridging the gap between larger economic players and underserved 
communities, ensuring that economic opportunities are equitably distributed across 
the county. By creating programs that address the needs of all communities and 
fostering partnerships that maximize resources, I would work to make Larimer County a 
place where everyone can thrive economically. 

*QUESTION 1: 

In 300 characters or less, please introduce yourself! 

Operations leader with 5+ years in scaling startups and driving impactful change. 
Passionate about revitalizing democracy through data-driven strategies and grassroots 
empowerment. Excited to help GoodParty.org make people matter more than money. 

*QUESTION 2: 

Why are you interested in GoodParty.org?. 

I am passionate about transforming our democracy to be more inclusive and 
representative. GoodParty.org's mission to empower everyday people to lead aligns 
with my values and professional experience in scaling initiatives that drive 
meaningful change. I want to help make democracy work better for everyone. 

OR 

Imagine a democracy where 'independent' isn’t a dirty word, but a rallying cry for 
real change. GoodParty.org isn’t just an organization; it's a movement breaking the 
doom loop of partisan politics. I’m eager to be part of this revolution, where people 
power trumps money, and ordinary citizens become civic superheroes. I want to help 
make history, one local win at a time. 

*QUESTION 3: 

Anything else you want to add? 

I believe in the power of scrappy determination mixed with smart strategy. Whether 
it’s scaling operations, empowering teams, or tackling seemingly insurmountable 
problems, I’m ready to roll up my sleeves for a cause as worthy as GoodParty.org. 
Let's disrupt the status quo and make history together. 

SEE FINAL SUBMISSION ENTRIES at very bottom of this doc 

*QUESTION 1: Personal Summary 

This section is optional. Use it to tell us a little more about yourself. 

I am an operations leader with a strong passion for driving impactful change and 
fostering growth within nonprofit and advocacy organizations. Over the past 18 years, 
I have focused on elevating organizational effectiveness through a commitment to 
innovation, community engagement, and operational resilience. I am deeply motivated 
by the opportunity to make a meaningful difference and have a track record of doing 
so by championing both people and processes. 

My journey has been marked by roles that demanded versatility, from managing 
multi-million-dollar budgets to leading strategic initiatives that strengthened 
organizational independence. My expertise in finance, compliance, and human resources 
allows me to navigate complex challenges with a holistic perspective, always with the 
aim of creating sustainable systems and empowering teams to excel. One of the key 
aspects I value most is aligning an organization's vision with actionable strategies 
that bring tangible outcomes, particularly in empowering underserved communities. 

I have a passion for fostering environments that encourage collaboration and 
inclusivity, even across global and distributed teams. For example, my experience 
working with USAID contractors across different time zones, including challenging 
regions such as Afghanistan and Pakistan, has underscored the importance of proactive 
communication and empathetic leadership. I believe that creating a supportive culture 
is the foundation for both individual and team success, especially when navigating 
diverse and asynchronous environments. 

I am also an avid learner and tech enthusiast, currently expanding my knowledge of 
artificial intelligence and machine learning through MIT coursework. I see the 
intersection of technology and social good as a promising avenue for the future, and 
I am enthusiastic about utilizing these tools to advance community initiatives and 
operational excellence. Being bilingual in English and Spanish further enhances my 
ability to connect with and support a wide range of communities, making me 
well-suited for environments that value diversity and inclusion. 

*QUESTION 2: 

Tell us more about why you want to be the Director of Operations with The ImPact. 

I am deeply motivated to join The ImPact as Director of Operations because of my 
belief in the power of strategic investment to drive sustainable, positive change. My 
career path, as seen in my resume, reflects a consistent dedication to mission-driven 
work, from managing nonprofit operations to ensuring financial accountability, which 
makes this position at The ImPact a natural and exciting next step for me. The 
ImPact's mission to align capital with social and environmental outcomes resonates 
with my personal values and professional experience in building operational 
structures that support impactful missions. I have always sought roles where I could 
leverage my skills to contribute meaningfully to organizations committed to community 
development, empowerment, and a positive societal impact, and The ImPact embodies 
these very principles. 

In my past roles, such as at Strings Music Festival and BuildStrong Academy, I have 
consistently focused on aligning operational efficiency with mission-driven goals, 
demonstrating my passion for maximizing impact through well-structured operations. I 
believe that effective operations serve as the backbone of any impactful 
organization, enabling it to amplify its reach and maximize the benefits delivered to 
stakeholders. At The ImPact, I see an incredible opportunity to bring my expertise in 
financial management, compliance, and people operations to bear, ensuring that the 
organization's internal processes are robust, scalable, and aligned with its 
ambitious objectives. 

What excites me most about this opportunity is the chance to work with a globally 
distributed team committed to advancing a more equitable world. My experience in 
managing diverse teams across different time zones has shown me that the key to 
success lies in creating inclusive systems that support asynchronous work while 
maintaining cohesion and purpose. I am eager to apply these learnings to help The 
ImPact's team operate seamlessly, regardless of location, and to foster a culture of 
trust and collaboration. 

I also see tremendous value in The ImPact's focus on measurable outcomes and 
accountability. My background in managing large-scale budgets and ensuring financial 
transparency aligns well with The ImPact's emphasis on responsible financial 
stewardship. I am eager to contribute to the organization's strategic planning and 
help guide its operational roadmap to ensure every initiative is backed by strong, 
data-driven insights that reinforce The ImPact's mission. 

Ultimately, I want to be part of an organization that doesn't just react to global 
challenges but actively works to shape a more sustainable and equitable future. I 
believe The ImPact is well-positioned to be a leader in this movement, and I am 
excited about the possibility of contributing to that vision as Director of 
Operations. 

*QUESTION 3: 

How many years of non-profit operations experience do you have? 

I have over 15 years of experience in nonprofit operations, spanning various 
leadership roles in both established and start-up organizations, including Austin 
Habitat for Humanity from June 2008 to July 2010 and Mi Casa Resource Center's 
Innovation Lab. My experience includes serving as Director of Operations at Strings 
Music Festival, where I oversaw financial management, vendor relations, and team 
operations, leading BuildStrong Academy's transition from fiscal sponsorship to an 
independent nonprofit entity, and working as Operations Manager / Start-up Consultant 
at Mi Casa Resource Center to open a new satellite office called the Innovation Lab. 
Throughout my career, I have consistently focused on optimizing processes, aligning 
operational efforts with organizational missions, and ensuring compliance, all with 
the aim of creating meaningful and sustainable community impact. 

*QUESTION 4: 

How many years of fiscal sponsorship operations experience do you have? 

I have 5 years of experience managing fiscal sponsorship operations. This experience 
was primarily gained during my time at BuildStrong Academy, where I played a pivotal 
role in transitioning the organization from being fiscally sponsored by the Colorado 
Nonprofit Development Center (CNDC) to becoming an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit. 
My responsibilities included strategic planning, financial management, and ensuring 
compliance throughout the transition process. Additionally, I oversaw the fiscal 
sponsorship operations to ensure accountability, transparency, and smooth financial 
operations until the organization achieved full independence. 

*Question 5: 

The ImPact’s mission is “To help families make more impact investments more 
effectively.” Why does this mission resonate with you? 

You can also read more about The ImPact's theory of change here: 
https://www.theimpact.org/theory-of-change 

The ImPact's mission resonates with me deeply because it is about harnessing the 
power of wealth to drive meaningful social and environmental change. Throughout my 
career, I have seen firsthand that while traditional philanthropy and government 
initiatives are crucial, they alone cannot solve the complex, interwoven challenges 
our society faces today. The ImPact’s approach to leveraging private capital for 
public good aligns perfectly with my belief that lasting change comes from a blend of 
financial innovation, strategic investment, and community-driven efforts. 

The emphasis on families as stewards of wealth who think long-term, yet act nimbly, 
particularly strikes a chord with me. I have always sought roles where I could 
contribute to systemic, impactful change, and I believe families have an unparalleled 
potential to create such an impact, not only for current stakeholders but for future 
generations. The ImPact's Theory of Change—centering on influencing market behavior, 
aligning capital towards high-impact enterprises, and fostering collaborative networks—resonates with my professional experience in building community initiatives 
and operational strategies that make a real difference. 

I am especially drawn to The ImPact’s focus on education, peer support, and 
data-driven insights, which help empower families to make informed impact 
investments. Throughout my career, I've been an advocate for transparency, measurable 
outcomes, and collaborative action. Whether managing the transition of BuildStrong 
Academy to an independent nonprofit or fostering inclusive operational cultures at 
Strings Music Festival, I have always prioritized initiatives that enable informed, 
strategic decisions that further organizational missions. 

Ultimately, I am inspired by The ImPact’s vision to make impact investing the market 
norm, rather than the exception. I am eager to be part of this transformative effort, 
helping to guide operational excellence that accelerates the flow of capital to those 
working to solve our world's most pressing challenges. I see The ImPact not just as 
an organization but as a catalyst for a larger movement, and I would be honored to 
contribute to this mission. 

*Question 6: 

Tell us about your own intellectual curiosity and how self-directed learning has 
shown up in your life. 

What are some of your current intellectual interests - how are you “feeding” those 
interests? 

My intellectual curiosity has always been a driving force in both my personal and 
professional life, leading me to continually seek new knowledge and skills to broaden 
my understanding of the world. This curiosity is not confined to one area but spans 
multiple fields, from operational strategies to emerging technologies, and has shown 
up in my career through a commitment to ongoing learning and adaptation. My pursuit 
of self-directed learning is evident in my recent focus on the intersection of 
technology and impact, particularly through my coursework in artificial intelligence 
and machine learning with MIT. I see AI and ML as powerful tools for amplifying 
operational efficiency and making informed, data-driven decisions, which could be 
transformative for mission-driven organizations. 

Beyond structured courses, I actively engage in reading on topics such as impact 
investing, sustainable development, and organizational behavior. I often explore 
literature that connects my interests in nonprofit management with innovative 
business practices, always looking for insights that can be applied to foster greater 
efficiency and social impact. Podcasts and webinars have also been instrumental in my 
learning journey; I enjoy diving into expert discussions on social entrepreneurship, scaling impact, and operational best practices, which provide me with diverse 
perspectives and ideas that I can apply in my work. 

One of my current intellectual interests is understanding how private sector 
investment can catalyze positive social and environmental outcomes. This aligns 
closely with The ImPact’s mission and has led me to explore case studies on 
successful impact investments and innovative financing models. Additionally, I am 
fascinated by the concept of inclusive leadership, especially in remote and 
asynchronous environments. My experience at USAID working with contractors in 
challenging settings has shown me the importance of inclusive practices, and I 
continue to learn how these can be refined and applied to diverse, distributed teams. 

Ultimately, my approach to self-directed learning is driven by a desire to not only 
understand new concepts but also apply them in ways that create tangible benefits for 
the communities and organizations I work with. Whether it is through formal 
education, reading, or engaging with thought leaders, I am constantly feeding my 
curiosity with the aim of making a meaningful difference.

*QUESTION 1 

Acknowledge the comparative analysis process for this position will consist of a 
review of my application materials to include preferred qualifications and required 
competencies. My responses to the supplemental questions will be scored based on my 
ability to follow instructions and provide detailed, clear and concise answers to 
each question. 

 Yes 

 No 

*QUESTION 2 

Describe how you keep track of multiple projects and deadlines and maintain momentum 
on projects that happen at the same time. Use specific examples if possible. 

To manage multiple projects and deadlines effectively, I utilize a combination of 
project management software and organizational tools to maintain both granular and 
big-picture focus. I most often use Asana when collaborating with high-performing 
teams, allowing me to break down projects into tasks, assign responsibilities, and 
set deadlines. This ensures that every team member is aligned, and progress is 
tracked in real-time, enabling the team to stay on course, even when projects 
overlap. 

For example, during a recent initiative at BuildStrong Academy, I was responsible for 
overseeing a major construction upgrade at our facility while simultaneously managing 
the installation of EV chargers on campus. I used Asana to manage task assignments, 
track deadlines, and maintain communication across departments, which ensured both 
projects moved forward without delay. In addition to using Asana’s timeline and task 
views to visualize project progress, I provided one-on-one and group training 
sessions to help team members feel confident managing their responsibilities within 
the software. This approach built accountability and made sure the team had the 
support needed to meet their deadlines. 

In addition to digital tools, I incorporate ‘on-desk ergonomic’ organizers, such as 
Fluidstance’s slope desk whiteboard and flow cards, to manage my time and priorities. 
These tools bring my attention to immediate critical needs, while also serving as 
visual reminders of long-term goals and project deliverables. I use the whiteboard to highlight urgent tasks that require same-day completion, and the flow cards as vision boards to keep the bigger picture of a project front and center. 

This combination of digital project management tools and physical organizers helps me 
keep track of multiple deadlines and maintain momentum, even when priorities shift. 
Colleagues often comment on my ability to meet deadlines with precision and attention 
to detail. I credit this success to the systems I’ve developed, which allow me to 
stay organized, manage complexity, and keep projects on track. 

*QUESTION 3 

Briefly describe your experience with financial reporting. Please include the names 
of financial statements you are accustomed to generating or explaining to others, and 
list what types of financial or accounting software you have used. 

I have extensive experience with financial reporting, including generating and 
analyzing key financial statements such as the Income Statement (Profit & Loss 
Statement), Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement. In my previous roles, I have 
provided detailed reports on budget allocations, expenditure tracking, and financial 
forecasts to senior leadership and boards of directors during quarterly and annual 
performance reviews. 

In addition to standard financial reporting, I have developed strong acumen in 
grant-related financial reporting and audits. At BuildStrong Academy, I was 
responsible for managing a $765,000 grant, which required me to prepare comprehensive 
financial reports for our funders and auditors, ensuring compliance with both federal 
and state regulations. I worked closely with external auditors during grant-related 
audits, ensuring that all documentation, expenditure tracking, and reporting 
processes met the required guidelines. My ability to navigate complex compliance 
frameworks has been crucial in maintaining transparency and accountability with our 
funders. 

I am proficient in using a variety of financial and accounting software, including 
QuickBooks, NetSuite, and Microsoft Excel, to manage and analyze financial data. I 
have also used Zoho CRM to track financial metrics for program funding and expenses, 
which allowed us to integrate operational and financial data more effectively. By 
creating custom financial reports, I was able to present clear and actionable 
insights to leadership, which helped inform budgeting decisions and strategic 
planning. 

One example of my sophisticated financial reporting experience involved conducting 
variance analyses to explain discrepancies between actual and forecasted 
expenditures, identifying areas for cost savings, and making recommendations to 
improve the organization's financial health. These reports often combined financial 
metrics with operational data to give leadership a comprehensive view of program 
performance. 
My experience managing large budgets, conducting financial analysis, and preparing 
grant-related reports has equipped me with the skills needed to ensure financial 
accuracy, compliance, and transparency in all financial reporting activities. 

*QUESTION 4 

This position involves teaching and supporting others on our team about processes 
and procedures. Please describe your experience teaching or training others and 
how you engage with different adult learning styles. 

I have considerable experience in training and developing team members, particularly 
in process improvements and operational procedures. Throughout my 18+ years as a 
versatile leader, I have learned to appreciate the diversity in learning styles and 
the importance of tailoring my teaching methods accordingly. It has been essential to 
adjust not only the teaching materials but also the methods by which they are 
delivered. This extra effort demonstrates to staff members or teams that I am 
dedicated to their learning experience and success. 

In my previous role, I designed and facilitated training programs for both new hires 
and seasoned employees on topics such as budget management, procurement processes, 
and compliance protocols. To engage a variety of learning styles, I employed multiple 
instructional techniques, including visual aids (like flowcharts and process maps) 
for visual learners, hands-on sessions for kinesthetic learners, and detailed written 
guides for those who prefer reading. Interactive discussions and Q&A sessions allowed 
learners to engage with the material at their own pace, and I reinforced learning 
through follow-up resources and one-on-one coaching as needed. 

One exciting development I’ve embraced in recent years is the evolution of SOP 
(Standard Operating Procedure) creation. Not all SOPs are created equal, and I’ve 
delved into the use of innovative tools that make access and execution of SOPs more 
efficient and engaging. For instance, I’ve contributed to building an intranet system 
that houses all of the company's SOPs, making them just a few clicks away depending 
on the file management ecosystem in use. 

I also utilize workflow intelligence platforms like Tango, which allows for the 
creation of step-by-step guides to document processes in detail for those who need 
more granular instructions. For more visual learners, tools like Loom have been 
invaluable, enabling me to record video tutorials that walk team members through 
processes in real-time, making complex procedures more accessible and easier to 
follow. By integrating these cutting-edge tools into my training strategy, I ensure 
that every team member has the resources they need to succeed, regardless of their 
learning style.

Question 1: Why is the Partnerships Lead right for you right now? * 

Empower Work's Partnerships Lead role represents a perfect alignment with both my 
professional journey and personal values. While it’s easy to claim a connection on an 
application, I believe my experience demonstrates it clearly. As reflected in my 
resume, I am drawn to mission-driven work that uplifts people and improves their 
working conditions. In all of my leadership roles, I’ve embraced a servant leadership 
approach, always aiming to lift up my teams, help them grow, and create environments 
where they can succeed and feel valued. 

A specific example of this was during my time as Operations Manager at BuildStrong 
Academy in Denver. One of my direct reports, Mrs. Hernández, was initially hired for 
a project support role. Recognizing her potential and her desire to grow within the 
organization, I mentored her in skills beyond her initial scope—accounting, project 
management, leadership, and ‘supervising up,’ among others. By the time her 
performance review came around, she was prepared and confident, with the skills to 
secure a promotion and take on more responsibility. This micro example illustrates my 
broader commitment to Empower Work’s goal of fostering healthy, equitable workplaces 
where people are valued, supported, and empowered. It’s a mission I believe in 
deeply. 

With over 18 years of experience in operations and partnership 
management—particularly in the nonprofit and workforce development sectors—I have 
honed my ability to build meaningful relationships that drive impact. My work at both 
the Innovation Lab (part of Mi Casa Resource Center) and BuildStrong Academy focused 
on empowering marginalized communities through workforce development programs. 
Whether it was training individuals for careers in the booming construction industry 
or offering financial coaching and career resources, my teams and I provided tools to 
help people overcome barriers and thrive. 

Empower Work’s mission resonates strongly with my passion for fostering environments 
where individuals can achieve economic mobility, emotional well-being, and career 
success. At this stage of my career, I am eager to leverage my skills and experience 
to amplify the impact of an organization like Empower Work. This role provides the 
ideal opportunity to do that. 

Question 2: Share an example of a time you saw a pain point for a partner you were 
working with and how you solved it. How did you identify the pain point? How did you 
address it with the partner? What was the outcome? * 

While leading operations at BuildStrong Academy, I identified a significant pain 
point for one of our partner organizations: the lack of real-time data sharing was 
hindering their ability to report on program outcomes and comply with their grant 
funder’s reporting requirements. This issue became apparent during one of our regular 
check-ins, as their team consistently raised concerns about delays in receiving 
updated information on our joint projects. 
To address this, I collaborated with both our internal data team and the partner’s 
leadership to thoroughly understand their needs. We implemented a centralized CRM 
system that provided real-time data access for both organizations. I also led 
training sessions to ensure their team could effectively use the new system. This 
solution not only resolved the reporting issue but also enhanced collaboration, 
enabling faster decision-making and increasing project efficiency by 15%. Ultimately, 
the successful resolution of this pain point strengthened our partnership and 
demonstrated the value of proactive, data-driven approaches. 

Another example involved a partner organization in a different state. Their executive 
director sought to establish a workforce development program similar to the 
construction training curriculum we had been developing at BuildStrong. Instead of 
viewing this as competition or protecting our proprietary curriculum, we recognized 
that supporting their efforts would create a mutually beneficial outcome. By sharing 
our expertise and resources, we helped them launch a robust training program in their 
community, ultimately benefiting both of our organizations. As the aphorism goes, "a 
rising tide lifts all boats"—their success was our success as well. 

Question 3: What about leading partnerships work and expansion would be energizing 
for you? * 

What energizes me most about leading partnerships is the opportunity to form 
meaningful relationships with people. As a full-blooded extrovert, I genuinely enjoy 
connecting with others—listening to their perspectives so they feel heard, and 
discovering commonalities and differences that help foster strong relationships, and 
sometimes even friendships. 

I thrive on identifying alignment between partners and collaborating to build 
structures that meet both immediate needs and long-term goals. Expanding partnerships 
that focus on supporting marginalized workers excites me because it combines two of 
my greatest passions: strategic thinking and human-centered service. I’ve spent much 
of my career working at this intersection, and the opportunity to help Empower Work 
scale its impact and deliver tangible benefits to millions of workers across the U.S. 
through well-executed partnerships is both deeply rewarding and essential to me.

Question 1: At Personified we aim to advance the progressive movement by running 
technology and security programs for our clients. Tell us why you’re interested in 
working at Personified.* 

As a career professional with experience in mission-driven organizations and 
nonprofits, I’ve often found myself managing IT responsibilities in addition to my 
core operational duties. While this challenge allowed me to develop new skills, it 
often pulled me away from critical strategies and initiatives. The difference was 
clear when I worked for a non-governmental organization with a dedicated IT 
team—having their support allowed me to focus on my core responsibilities and enhance 
overall operational efficiency. 

What excites me about Personified is not only the essential IT services you provide 
but also your focus on building personal connections with clients, even down to 
knowing their pets’ names. This emphasis on the human element is incredibly 
refreshing, especially in IT, where empathy and communication are sometimes 
overlooked. I strongly resonate with your commitment to being the first point of 
contact, as I believe first impressions are crucial to success. As People and Revenue 
Operations Director, I would strive to ensure that same level of care and attention 
throughout the entire employee lifecycle, fostering a culture where positive first 
impressions extend into lasting relationships. 

Question 2: The People and Revenue Operations Director will oversee Personified’s 
people and HR function. We’re looking for a candidate who has robust experience 
developing, implementing, and managing people policies, processes, and programs. Tell 
us about your experience overseeing people and HR programs and why this makes you a 
good fit for this position.* 

The best example to illustrate a robust experience developing, implementing, and 
managing people policies, processes, and programs is to use my last position as 
Director of Operations at Strings Music. Strings Music is recognized as a 
high-performing music venue delivering innovative music, drawing from both classical 
and popular genres. While it caters to the local community’s musical tastes in and 
around Steamboat Springs, it also appears to the broader I-70 corridor in 
Northeastern Colorado. My principal role was to direct operations and technical 
production units, streamline logistics for the flawless execution of premium events, 
performances, and other critical profit centers. My role as Director of Operations 
was the organization’s first ever in its 36-year history, so, needless to say, I was 
honored to have the chance to execute the vision for this new role while appreciating 
the significant challenges that lay ahead given an organization’s tendency resisting 
changes or overhauls. However, within my first 6 weeks in the new role, what stood 
out the most was the lack of any modernized HR structure or updated policies that 
aligned with the HR industry’s best and most up-to-date practices. Without a clear 
hierarchical representation that could serve as a useful visual aid for the staff and 
the Board of Directors my first step was to create an org chart using LucidChart. I have experience creating these types of documents in prior operational roles and knew 
the importance of not only having an updated org chart, but one that could be shared 
openly with the staff so that there were no misrepresentations of each staff member’s 
respective role within the organization. My second project was to refine Strings’ 
hiring and onboarding process. Part of my function was to oversee the production and 
technical teams that would execute our event and show schedule year-round. In the 
entertainment industry, while it may not be common knowledge, there is a higher than 
average turnover rate among technicians and other personnel to run lights, audio, 
stage management, backstage, security, and hospitality; however, during my tenure the 
confluence of the pandemic and the lifestyle in a ski resort area (Steamboat Springs, 
CO) only exacerbated this trend, thus placing enormous pressure on me to constantly 
recruit for our entertainment venue to ensure timely and perfect execution 100% of 
the time. And even though my company had dealt with this issue long before I stepped 
on as Director of Operations, upon taking over the recruitment rounds, there was no 
established set of procedures or system to attract job candidates and usher them 
along the various recruitment stages. So my second act as Operations Director was to 
codify the recruitment system, first, with modernization as its backbone, by ensuring 
all job descriptions were digitized and followed branding standards; created standard 
interview questions to be adopted by all departments for the initial phone 
interviews, subsequent department-head or panel interviews to create consistency 
throughout. Adopting and incorporating an interview scorecard brought standardization 
to the company’s hiring practices and aided in moving the candidate process along 
quickly, efficiently, and democratically. During my tenure as Director of Operations, 
I ushered in 40 new hires, ranging from full-time employees, part-time employees, and 
independent contractors to deliver and execute upon the Strings’ mission and vision. 

USEFUL JOB APPLICATION COPY (don’t use in application question) In the music business 
there are seasonal ebbs and flows to putting on shows and by far our biggest was 
during the summer. Given the latter it was imperative to boost our staff and 
technical team footprint to increase our capacity to deliver on our jammed packed 
summer schedule. After witnessing the current screening, interviewing, and onboarding 
process, which was often inconsistent, missing a clear paper (or electronic) trail, 
administered without a consistent set of questions depending on the position type 
that could have easily been targeted for its potential infraction as a discriminatory 
hiring practice, I saw a lot of room for improvement. First, as Operations Director, 
I took the lead on being a part of each step in the interview process so as to ensure 
that each job candidate not only had the right set of technical skills but also had 
the soft skills and would be a great cultural fit for the organization. I relied upon 
the other department heads to play a part in screening and interviewing the 
candidates, too, because they could view the candidate(s) in question from different 
perspectives and flag certain aspects that I may not catch on the first or second 
round of interviewing. I created a standard set of questions for phone screening and 
the first in-person interview so the hiring panel was asking the same set of 
questions regardless of who the interviewee was. Also, by entrusting my colleagues, 
it only proved to fortify and democratize the hiring process. During my tenure as 
Director of Operations, I ushered in 40 new hires, ranging from full-time employees, 
part-time employees, and independent contractors to deliver and execute upon the 
Strings’ mission and vision. 

Beyond improving the recruiting, screening, and interviewing process, my next 
objective was to clean up our employee manual which had not been updated since 2017. 
Working with Employers Council, which is a dedicated group of HR professionals, 
executives, legal teams, and other professionals across a broad array of employment 
law, compliance, and HR needs, I signed up for their online workshops to ascertain 
the latest employee policies (geared towards an organization of our size, type, and 
makeup) and teach myself the new HR practices, laws, and tools that would help me 
modernize our outdated employee manual, which I completed, with the help of my 
Operations Manager for administrative and textual support, prior to exiting this 
role. 

Lastly, I took the initiative to overhaul our company’s performance review processes 
with a focus on creating more robust support for both employees and managers. The 
first step was implementing a more structured system to ensure that underperformers 
were identified early and provided with clear opportunities for improvement. This 
included the development of performance improvement plans (PIPs) and targeted 
retraining programs, ensuring that no team member slipped through the cracks without 
support. 

Additionally, I equipped managers and directors with the necessary tools to monitor 
performance effectively and offer actionable feedback. This included the introduction 
of detailed performance metrics and a feedback framework that enabled managers to 
provide precise, constructive feedback aimed at both improvement and sustainability 
of high performance. Regular check-ins and performance dashboards made it easier for 
leadership to track progress and adjust strategies where needed. 

Finally, to safeguard the integrity of our events and shows, I worked closely with 
leadership to design a system that helped identify 'bad actors'—employees whose 
actions were negatively impacting our efforts. We created a process to root out 
behaviors that undermined our mission of delivering top-tier music events, which 
allowed the organization to better align its team with its strategic goals. This 
holistic approach not only improved individual performance but strengthened the 
organization’s overall capability to put on the best events possible. 

Question 3: Personified has grown to a team of 20 in under 3 years. Our People and 
Revenue Operations Director will be responsible for developing the organizational 
infrastructure, including cross-functional processes and systems that will support 
the operation and team as we grow. Tell us about a time you developed and implemented 
an organizational policy, process or system. What were the considerations? How did 
you communicate with and invest the team? What was the result?* 

In my role as Operations Manager with BuildStrong Academy of Colorado, I oversaw 
end-to-end recruitment for high-impact roles for our construction apprenticeship 
programs, which placed the refinement of our hiring processes, not only internally, 
but with the private homebuilders that we partnered with, smack center in my domain. 
A system that I am proud to share with you is the development of a pioneering 
approach to build a CRM at BuildStrong Academy from scratch. This was not an idea 
that originated with the executives (in other words, I didn't ask for permission, but 
asked for forgiveness later) but it was an immediate need that I foresaw that would 
greatly aid our team of recruiters, career coaches, trainers, employers, and the 
students all at the same time. It all started with my desire to improve stakeholder 
data tracking, which meant transforming our recruiting process to become 
state-of-the-art, and allowing us to report accurately to our funders, both private, 
state, and federal. I simply took the reigns and asked for forgiveness later because 
the vision I had for incorporating this new system was as clear as day and knew it 
would benefit my direct reports ability to work and perform more efficiently, it 
would lead to enormous cost savings after determining how much in terms of increased 
productivity (fewer hours would be spent tracking prospect recruits the old way via 
paperwork, locating lost emails about a particular lead, etc.), and the recruiting 
process could be structure in such a way as to track lead generation, lead 
qualification, initial contact, presentation or demo, negotiation, and closing the 
deal all within the CRM, allowing me to measure our recruiting pipeline 
instantaneously and pinpoint breakdowns, weaknesses, strengths, marketing impacts, 
etc. The end result of this new system was a 30% reduction in time-to-hire while 
maintaining high candidate satisfaction scores.

In my role as Director of Operations at Strings Music, I was responsible for 
developing and implementing people policies, processes, and programs, especially in a 
high-turnover industry like entertainment. As the organization’s first Director of 
Operations in its 36-year history, I led a comprehensive overhaul of HR and 
operational functions to support both staff and leadership more effectively. 

One of my first steps was creating a modernized organizational chart using LucidChart 
to clarify roles and reporting structures across the company. This simple, but 
critical, visual aid allowed staff and the Board of Directors to understand their 
respective roles and ensured transparency within the organization. 

I also revamped the hiring and onboarding process, addressing a long-standing 
challenge of high turnover by creating a structured recruitment system. This included 
digitizing job descriptions, standardizing interview questions, and introducing 
interview scorecards to promote consistency and efficiency in hiring. During my 
tenure, I successfully recruited and onboarded 40 new hires, including full-time 
staff, part-time employees, and contractors. 

Additionally, I collaborated with Employers Council to modernize our employee manual, 
which had not been updated since 2017. By participating in HR workshops, I 
implemented industry best practices and legal updates relevant to our organization’s 
size and structure. This ensured compliance and improved employee relations. 

Lastly, I overhauled our performance review processes. I implemented structured 
systems for early identification of underperformance, established performance 
improvement plans (PIPs), and provided targeted retraining. To empower managers, I 
introduced performance metrics and feedback tools, facilitating ongoing progress 
tracking and improvement. I also developed systems to identify and address any 'bad 
actors,' safeguarding the integrity of our operations and events. 

These initiatives not only improved individual performance but also helped align the 
entire team with Strings Music’s mission of delivering world-class music events. 

Question 3: Personified has grown to a team of 20 in under 3 years. Our People and 
Revenue Operations Director will be responsible for developing the organizational 
infrastructure, including cross-functional processes and systems that will support 
the operation and team as we grow. Tell us about a time you developed and implemented 
an organizational policy, process or system. What were the considerations? How did 
you communicate with and invest the team? What was the result?* 

In my role as Operations Manager at BuildStrong Academy of Colorado, I spearheaded 
the development of a custom CRM system to address inefficiencies in our recruitment 
process for our construction apprenticeship programs. This initiative was driven by 
my recognition of the need for better stakeholder data tracking and reporting to our 
private, state, and federal funders. Without waiting for executive approval, I took 
the lead in designing and implementing the system, confident that it would 
significantly improve our internal processes. 

The CRM I developed streamlined our entire recruitment process, from lead generation 
to candidate placement. It allowed our team of recruiters, career coaches, and 
trainers to track the full lifecycle of each candidate—from initial contact through 
to hire—while reducing manual tasks and paperwork. This new system enabled us to 
monitor key stages such as lead qualification, presentation, and negotiation, 
ultimately enhancing our ability to identify bottlenecks and optimize performance. 

The implementation of the CRM resulted in a 30% reduction in time-to-hire, while also 
maintaining high satisfaction scores from both candidates and partners. Additionally, 
it led to significant cost savings by improving productivity and reducing time spent 
on outdated tracking methods. The success of this system not only improved our 
recruitment outcomes but also demonstrated the value of proactive, cross-functional 
solutions to the entire organization. 

Questions for Further Clarification and Variety: 

1. Project Management and Round Management: 
. You mentioned your experience guiding hiring managers and coordinating 
processes at BuildStrong Academy and USAID. Could you provide an 
example from either Strings Music or the Innovation Lab where you also 
coordinated recruitment rounds, designed evaluation steps, or managed 
timelines? Adding another example from a different role could further 
demonstrate your broad experience in this area. 
i. Coordinated recruitment rounds & round management: in my most 
recent position as Director of Operations, I was in charge of the 
production and technical teams that would execute our event and 
show schedule year-round. In the entertainment industry, while it 
may not be common knowledge, there is a higher than average 
turnover rate among technicians and other personnel to run lights, 
audio, stage management, backstage, security, and hospitality; 
however, the confl uence of the pandemic and the lifestyle in a ski 
resort area only exacerbated this trend, thus placing enormous 
pressure on me to constantly recruit for our entertainment venue to 
ensure timely and perfect execution 100% of the time. And even 
though my company had dealt with this issue long before I stepped 
on as Director of Operations, upon taking over the recruitment 
rounds, there was no established set of procedures or system to 
attract job candidates and usher them along the various recruitment 
stages. So one of my fi rst acts as Operations Director was to codify 
the recruitment system, fi rst, with modernization as its backbone, by 
ensuring all job descriptions were digitized and followed branding 
standards; created standard interview questions to be adopted by all 
departments for the initial phone interviews, subsequent 
department-head or panel interviews to create consistency 
throughout. Adopting and incorporating an interview scorecard 
brought standardization to the company’s hiring practices and aided 
in moving the candidate process along quickly, efficiently, and 
democratically. 
ii. Designed Evaluation Steps: 
1. my role as Program Operations Advisor at USAID involved 
managing recruitment and onboarding processes in 
high-stakes international environments. Here’s how this 
experience directly applies to designing evaluation steps: 
a. Developing Assessment Criteria: 

i. In a high-stakes, government-driven 
environment like USAID, particularly in the 
Bureau for Democracy, Confl ict and 
Humanitarian Assistance where I was assigned, 
while I could rely on an already-established 
rigorous criteria that the federal government 
established for evaluating all job candidates, my 
department, the Office of Transition Initiatives, 
required me to assess candidates for roles in 
challenging environments, often hostile, 
focusing on both their technical skills and their 
ability to work under pressure. Criteria included 
not only experience and qualifi cations but also 
qualities like adaptability, cultural sensitivity, 
and alignment with USAID’s mission. 

b. Creating Interview Questions and Assessment Tools: 
i. You likely designed specifi c questions and 
evaluation exercises tailored to the geopolitical 
and operational needs of the regions where USAID 
operated (e.g., Afghanistan and Pakistan). These 
assessment tools might have included 
scenario-based questions, technical assessments, 
or situational judgment tests designed to evaluate 
a candidate’s readiness for complex assignments. 

c. Standardizing the Evaluation Process: 
i. Given the structured nature of government 
operations, your role probably involved 
implementing standardized evaluation processes 
to ensure fairness and consistency. This could have 
involved creating scoring rubrics, guidelines for 
interviews, and procedures for comparing 
candidates across different stages of evaluation. 

d. Incorporating Feedback Mechanisms: 
i. Working with multiple stakeholders, including fi eld 
offices, program managers, and local leaders, you 
would have incorporated diverse feedback into the 
evaluation process. Gathering and analyzing input 
from different sources would have been essential 
in refi ning the recruitment process and ensuring 
that candidates met both technical and cultural 
requirements. 

2. Infrastructure and Back-End Systems: 

. Your experience building a CRM at BuildStrong is impressive. Did you have 
any experience with setting up or optimizing recruitment or operational 
systems at Strings Music or the Innovation Lab? For example, did you 
implement any digital tools, applicant tracking systems, or other 
infrastructure improvements that streamlined operations or recruitment 
processes? 
. Applicant tracking systems & infrastructure improvements: 
i. I would like to use the sentence "I oversaw end-to-end recruitment 
for high-impact roles” and tie it to my job as Operations Manager at 
BuildStrong Academy. For instance, "I led the end-to-end 
recruitment for high-impact training candidates for our construction 
apprenticeship programs, refi ning our hiring processes, not only 
internally, but with our private homebuilders that led to a 30% 
reduction in time-to-hire while maintaining high candidate 
satisfaction scores." 2) I would also like to tie in the development of a 
pioneering approach never attempted before to build a CRM at 
BuildStrong Academy from scratch. This was not an idea that 
originated with the executives (in other words, I didn't ask for 
permission, but asked for forgiveness later) but a great need that I 
saw immediately because of my desire to improve stakeholder data 
tracking, transforming our recruiting process to become 
state-of-the-art, and allowing us to report accurately to our funders, 
both private, state, and federal. I simply took the reigns and asked for 
forgiveness later because the vision I had for incorporating this new 
system was as clear as day and knew it would benefi t my direct 
reports ability to work and perform more efficiently, it would lead to 
enormous cost savings after determining how much in terms of 
increased productivity (fewer hours would be spent tracking 
prospect recruits the old way via paperwork, locating lost emails 
about a particular lead, etc.), and the recruiting process could be 
structure in such a way as to track lead generation, lead qualifi cation, 
initial contact, presentation or demo, negotiation, and closing the 
deal all within the CRM, allowing me to measure our recruiting 
pipeline instantaneously and pinpoint breakdowns, weaknesses, 
strengths, marketing impacts, etc. 
ii. Another example is as Director of Operations at Strings: At Strings 
Music, I recognized that our event operations and stakeholder 
engagement required a more streamlined and cohesive system to 
manage workfl ows across multiple departments. I took the lead in 
implementing a digital event planner and scheduler that was built as 
a project management tool that integrated scheduling, resource 
allocation, and task tracking for all of the end users. This tool transformed our operations by centralizing data, enhancing 
cross-departmental collaboration to plan and execute our more than 
100+ events and shows each year,, and providing real-time insights 
into project data that revealed trends that informed more timely 
executive decisions on staffing and resource needs. By consolidating 
disparate processes into a single platform, I was able to improve 
communication, eliminate redundancies, avoid costly scheduling 
errors, and increase efficiency across our event management 
processes. 
iii. Additionally, I oversaw the transition from manual tracking methods 
to a cloud-based system that streamlined our reporting and fi nancial 
management. This infrastructure upgrade allowed us to track event 
budgets, vendor contracts, and performance metrics more 
effectively, enabling better decision-making and cost control. My 
experience in identifying operational gaps, setting up digital 
systems, and driving infrastructure improvements aligns directly with 
Open Philanthropy’s focus on maintaining robust applicant tracking 
and work test submission systems. 

3. Candidate Evaluation and Relationship Management: 
. You highlighted your experience in candidate relationship management and 
evaluation at BuildStrong and USAID. At Strings Music or the Innovation 
Lab, did you conduct interviews, manage candidate interactions, or play a 
role in evaluating potential hires or key stakeholders? Specifi c examples 
from these roles would further showcase your ability to evaluate and 
manage relationships across different sectors. 
i. In all of my managerial roles, I have had a major role in not only the 
recruitment aspect of my respective department, but also played an 
active role in screening and interviewing potential hires to ensure 
that they were the right fi t for my department and, more importantly, 
my team. At the Innovation Lab, my limited budget and resources 
made the importance of having the ‘right people on the bus’, so to 
speak, super critical, and I ensured that I was part of each step of the 
interview process. I looked to my trusted colleagues, at the time, to also 
play a part in screening and interviewing because they could view the 
candidate(s) in question from different perspectives and fl ag certain 
aspects that I may not catch on the fi rst or second round. By entrusting 
my colleagues, it only proved to fortify and democratize the hiring 
process. I ended up employing 3 full-time employees, 3 part-time 
employees, and 4 independent contractors to deliver and execute upon 
the Innovation Lab’s commitment to provide career training, small 
business development, as well as technology and fi nancial literacy 
training to the Northeast Park Hill community near Denver and beyond. 

4. Process Optimization and Iterative Improvements: 
. Your process improvements at BuildStrong are well-documented. Can you 
provide additional examples from Strings Music or the Innovation Lab 
where you optimized workfl ows, restructured processes, or implemented 
continuous improvement strategies? These examples would emphasize your 
ability to drive efficiency in various contexts. 

5. Adaptability and Flexibility in a Rapidly Growing Organization: 
. You’ve already provided great examples from BuildStrong and USAID. At 
Strings Music or the Innovation Lab, did you navigate any signifi cant 
changes or challenges that required fl exibility and quick adaptation? For 
instance, did you lead any initiatives during periods of growth, crisis, or 
shifting priorities? 
i. Before I was hired as the Operations and Start-Up Manager to launch 
the Innovation Lab, there was no blueprint or roadmap that I was 
handed. The organization that hired me relied on my entrepreneurial 
skills and start-up mentality to start from scratch, much as you would 
starting up a business, beginning with a marketing assessment to 
ascertain whether there was a target market for the two primary 
economic development services, business startups and career 
training. After meeting with community leaders, residents, and other 
agency heads, such as the Commanding Officer at the local police 
district, state and county officials assigned to the district, and other 
infl uential leaders, I was able to design and plan the type of 
programming that I would initiate in the launch phase, but also 
building in fl exibility to my model to ensure that any unforeseen 
opportunities couldn’t be incorporated. By employing a lean project 
management methodology, I helped the Innovation Lab navigate 
through the choppy waters of initial service offerings that did not 
resonate with the community (i.e. offering advanced business 
courses when the majority of interest was in Starting a Business 101) 
and being nimble enough to change tact, reconfi gure service 
offerings, and adjust the Innovation Lab’s strategy to meet and 
adapt to the community’s needs head on. The pace of growth in the 
fi rst two years of the Innovation Lab was exponential with my office 
delivering fi nancial and business education training to over 1,000 
small business owners annually within the fi rst two years of its 
launch. Over the course of the two years that I was the Operations 
and Start-Up Manager, I directed the Innovation Lab through the 
major business cycles, starting with the idea phase, market research, validation, program design (equivalent to product design), marketing, 
sales, execution, and expansion. 
ii. Another transformative experience was my work for 
Peace Corps, spanning nearly four years, which instilled 
in me the skill of transforming concepts into tangible 
business models. My involvement working alongside 
Paraguayans and Mennonites for a diverse dairy 
cooperative in a region of Paraguay called the Chaco, 
(not completely suited for agriculture) led to improved 
operational efficiency, strategic alignment, and a 
stronger business model. Among my various 
experiences, this stands out, showcasing my capacity to 
make a signifi cant impact even when confronted with 
less than ideal work conditions and limited resources in 
a remote community with limited access to resources, a 
reliable workforce, and incredibly extreme 
environmental conditions, such as drought, societal 
vulnerability to issues such as racism and 
discrimination. 
6. Alignment with Mission and Values: 
. You’ve demonstrated alignment with Open Philanthropy’s mission through 
your work at USAID and BuildStrong Academy. Do you have any specifi c 
examples from Strings Music or the Innovation Lab that showcase your 
commitment to mission-driven work, such as supporting the arts, 
education, or community development? Highlighting these could provide 
additional context and variety. 
i. My career has been guided by a commitment to 
advancing mission-driven initiatives that empower 
communities and foster long-term growth. Whether 
supporting arts education and youth development at 
Strings Music or driving local economic empowerment 
through small business coaching and fi nancial literacy 
programs at the Innovation Lab, I’ve sought to create 
lasting impact in the communities I serve. Open 
Philanthropy’s dedication to maximizing global impact 
through strategic giving and transparent knowledge 
sharing resonates deeply with this ethos, and I am 
excited about the opportunity to contribute to their 
work in addressing the world’s most critical challenges. 
ii. My work at the Innovation Lab is in line with my 
overarching aim to drive economic empowerment and 
catalyze social progress, marking a vital step in my journey to effect long-lasting change in underserved 
communities. This opportunity offered me a platform to 
encourage collaborative efforts among like-minded 
professionals, scale impactful initiatives, and confront 
pressing community challenges head-on. 

Your responses to these questions will allow me to further diversify the examples in your 
cover letter and showcase your strengths across multiple roles. Let me know what 
additional insights you can share!

*QUESTION 4: 

How would you ensure that economic and business service efforts benefit all 
communities in Larimer County? 

To ensure that economic and business service efforts benefit all communities in 
Larimer County, I would focus on creating accessible, inclusive, and community-driven 
initiatives. This begins with active outreach and engagement with diverse community stakeholders, including underrepresented groups, rural residents, and small 
businesses. I would conduct thorough needs assessments to understand the specific 
challenges and opportunities within each community. By leveraging data and community 
input, I would design targeted programs that address the unique economic needs of 
each area. If no such system exists for capturing the data, it is imperative that 
such a system be created. Bringing evidence-based findings and solutions could bring 
a tremendous amount of transparency around ensuring all communities (i.e., targeted 
zip codes, business-related zones, etc.) receive economic and business services. 
Additionally, I would establish feedback loops, such as a Google Form survey, to 
gather consistent feedback from local business owners about their satisfaction and 
service needs, adapting services as community needs evolve. This approach would help 
ensure that the benefits of economic growth reach everyone, regardless of geography 
or socioeconomic status. 

*QUESTION 5: 

What experience do you have where you have fostered collaboration between government, 
business, and community organizations to support sustainable economic growth at a 
local or regional level? 

In my role as Operations Manager at the Colorado Homebuilding Academy, I fostered 
collaboration between multiple stakeholders, including government entities, local 
schools, industry partners, and community organizations. One notable example was my 
leadership in spearheading a collaboration between a nonprofit agency, the 
HomeBuilder Institute (HBI), our primary benefactor Oakwood Homes (the second largest 
private homebuilder in Colorado), the franchise expert 'Franchise for Good,' and the 
Department of Labor. Together, we created a viable, replicable, and working model 
construction trades program, which has now expanded beyond Colorado to include 
Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and Arizona. This collaboration brought together expertise 
and resources from various sectors to create a program that effectively addressed 
workforce needs while ensuring the model could be scaled to benefit other regions. By 
aligning the goals of educators, businesses, and policymakers, we not only addressed 
the construction labor shortage but also provided a pathway for youth to access 
sustainable, high-paying careers. This collaborative approach, which has now expanded 
beyond Colorado to include Florida, Louisiana, Texas, and Arizona, resulted in a 70% 
growth in the program, demonstrating the power of coordinated efforts to drive 
sustainable economic growth. 

*QUESTION 6: 

Please choose one of the Larimer County guiding principles listed that you feel most 
applies to you and this position - Larimer County will add value to the lives of its 
citizens today and in the future by: 

. Being good stewards of public resources. 

. Promoting innovation, adaptability, and committing to continuous improvement. 

. Providing consistent quality customer service. 

. Empowering people to take responsibility. 

. Cultivating inclusive and collaborative partnerships 

. Being a fulfilling, enjoyable, and inclusive place to work. 

*QUESTION 7: 

Based on your choice in the previous question, describe how you would apply this 
guiding principle in this position. 

In the role of Associate Director of Economic Development, I would apply the 
principle of cultivating inclusive and collaborative partnerships by actively 
engaging with a wide range of stakeholders, including community members, local 
businesses, educational institutions, and government entities. My approach would be 
to establish open channels of communication and foster trust among these groups to 
ensure that everyone's voices are heard and valued in the decision-making process. I 
would also focus on bridging the gap between larger economic players and underserved 
communities, ensuring that economic opportunities are equitably distributed across 
the county. By creating programs that address the needs of all communities and 
fostering partnerships that maximize resources, I would work to make Larimer County a 
place where everyone can thrive economically.

Dear Dr. Karam,
I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Adjunct Faculty position within the
Department of Management at Colorado State University. With a career spanning over two
decades, I have consistently demonstrated my passion for teaching, my entrepreneurial spirit,
and my strategic acumen, making me a well-suited candidate for this role.
Throughout my professional journey, I have held numerous positions where my ability to teach
and train colleagues and customers was paramount. As the Operations Director at Strings
Music Festival, I orchestrated significant operational improvements and strategic initiatives,
ensuring both the organization’s and my team’s success. This role underscored my innate
ability to educate and mentor, fostering an environment where everyone could thrive.
During my tenure at BuildStrong Academy, I leveraged my expertise in program management
and technology integration to drive substantial growth. My efforts in training trade workers and
enhancing marketing strategies resulted in remarkable revenue increases and cost savings.
This experience honed my skills as a strategist and educator, solidifying my belief that welltrained
teams are the cornerstone of any successful organization.
As an Operations Business Manager and Small Business Consultant at the Innovation Lab
in Northeast Park Hill, Denver, I launched and managed outreach programs, established
key partnerships, and provided financial and business education to small business owners
throughout the Denver Metro area. This role involved constant innovation, problem-solving,
and a jack-of-all-trades approach to fulfill the vision of the Innovation Lab. My efforts were
recognized by local congressmen, district police commanders, and Governor Hickenlooper for
the quality of programs and customer service rendered to the community.
I surveyed and analyzed the economic development challenges of the community and
addressed these challenges through various programs and training. Partnering with local
microfinance institutions and the Small Business Administration, I developed financially viable
models to cater to the credit needs of the entrepreneurial community. Leading a team and
managing a $500K annual budget, I spearheaded a brand awareness campaign that resulted
in a steady influx of early adopters and influencers.
Holding a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a Minor in Marketing & Procurement
from the University of San Diego, and a certification in Full Stack Web Development from
CodeCraft School of Technology, I have continuously pursued educational and professional
development. My certifications and awards, including the Project Management Certification
from Google, further attest to my dedication to excellence.
The opportunity to join the esteemed faculty at Colorado State University is both exciting and
inspiring. I am eager to bring my extensive experience in teaching, program management, and
strategic planning to contribute to the Department of Management. I am confident that my
unique background and passion for education will allow me to make meaningful contributions
to your team and the broader academic community.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my
skills and experiences align with the goals of Colorado State University.
Sincerely,
Roberto Hernández

Dear Mr. Sewell,
Congratulations on your recent role at Ursa Major! I am thrilled about the opportunity to join your
team as the Business Operations Manager. With over 18 years of experience in program and
operations leadership, I am eager to leverage my expertise in business process standardization,
operational scalability, and financial analytics to support Ursa Major Technologies.
I was particularly inspired by Ursa Major’s recent successful test flight of the Hadley engine,
which marked a significant milestone in hypersonic vehicle development. This accomplishment
not only underscores Ursa Major’s innovative prowess but also highlights the critical role of
effective operations and business development in achieving such feats. I am confident that my
background in business development and operations would have enabled me to contribute
significantly to this project by implementing efficient processes, managing budgets, and
conducting financial analysis to drive performance and market positioning.
In my current role as Director of Operations at Strings, I lead a dynamic team to execute highquality
events, develop cohesive operational strategies, and foster a culture of continuous
improvement. My efforts have resulted in significant enhancements in organizational efficiency
and effectiveness. I have successfully standardized business processes, scaled operations,
and utilized data analysis to inform strategic decision-making, aligning perfectly with the
requirements of the Business Operations Manager role at Ursa Major.
At BuildStrong Academy of Colorado, I spearheaded business development and expansion
efforts, resulting in additional revenue streams of over $1.25M in 2021. My experience includes
developing and implementing replicable training models, leveraging technology to improve
user engagement, and driving operational outcomes. I have a proven track record in budget
management and financial analytics, having managed grants totaling $2.5M and implemented
financial planning strategies that enhanced the academy’s financial performance.
Moreover, my role as Operations Manager and Small Business Consultant at Innovation Lab
equipped me with the skills to launch and manage outreach programs, develop financially viable
models, and build strong partnerships with community organizations. My ability to conduct
detailed financial analyses and manage budgets effectively has been instrumental in driving
organizational success and achieving strategic goals.
Ursa Major’s commitment to addressing the critical shortfall in the U.S. industrial base and
bringing a new model to aerospace and defense systems resonates deeply with my own
professional values and aspirations. Your mission to mold tomorrow’s technologies while
deploying today’s best aligns perfectly with my career goals and expertise.
I hold a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a minor in Marketing & Procurement
from the University of San Diego and a Full Stack Web Development certificate from CodeCraft

Dear Mr. Watt,
With the data management landscape rapidly evolving, Anomalo stands at the
forefront of innovation, addressing the critical challenge of data quality with
unparalleled AI-driven solutions. This unique positioning is what draws me to
your dynamic team. I am eager to bring my extensive experience in operations
leadership, strategic planning, and business development to further enhance
Anomalo’s mission of revolutionizing data quality and reliability.
In my previous role as Director of Operations at Strings Music Festival, I led operations
and technical production teams, optimized logistics, and implemented datadriven
strategies to address data quality and data issues. By developing dynamic
pricing models based on real-time data analytics and audience segmentation,
we tailored ticket prices to maximize attendance and revenue. Additionally, we
enhanced marketing campaigns through targeted digital advertising and strategic
partnerships, which expanded our reach and attracted a broader audience. These
efforts collectively increased event revenue by 25%. Simultaneously, I introduced
lean production techniques and renegotiated vendor contracts, which streamlined
our operations and reduced production costs by 15%.
At BuildStrong Academy of Colorado, I successfully led an operations team that
focused on sales, marketing, accounting, job placement, grants management, and
data analytics. This experience equipped me with the skills necessary to support
Anomalo’s growth and ensure the integration and execution of high-impact
projects. I developed scalable workforce training models that were replicated
as a franchise, demonstrating my ability to manage and scale complex initiatives
effectively.
Additionally, I have always prioritized addressing data quality and data issues in
my roles, ensuring that our strategies were robust and our operations seamless.
I understand the importance of enterprise data and how crucial it is for driving
informed decision-making and achieving organizational goals.
Please consider my application not only for my extensive experience but also for
my incredible ambition and unmatched desire to learn and incorporate AI into my
professional, entrepreneurial, and personal life. I believe this drive to innovate and
improve aligns perfectly with Anomalo’s values and goals.
I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work at Anomalo due to the
company’s commitment to innovation and its values-driven culture. The emphasis
on rational optimism, ownership, and transparency resonates with my professional
ethos. I am confident that my skills and experience make me a strong fit for the
Director of Operations role, and I am eager to contribute to Anomalo’s continued
success.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to

Dear Mr. Stephens,
Your commitment to sustainability, innovation, and creating a circular economy aligns with my
professional values and experience. With extensive expertise in operational scalability, data
quality, and customer satisfaction, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Reebelo’s
mission as the Chief Operating Officer.

I implemented several eco-friendly initiatives that reduced waste and promoted recycling,
aligning closely with Reebelo’s mission to reduce e-waste and promote a circular economy.

Scaling
Reebelo’s high-growth phase excites me. I have successfully scaled operations at BuildStrong
Academy, developing a replicable workforce training model that will expand into 10 new
territories by 2025. I am eager to bring this experience to Reebelo, supporting its ambitious
growth plans.

Leveraging technology to improve operations has been a hallmark of my career. I have
implemented enterprise software solutions, data visualization tools, and automated processes
to enhance operational efficiency. My tech-savvy approach aligns well with Reebelo’s focus on
technology-driven growth.
Data
Data-driven decision-making is central to my operational strategy. I utilized advanced data
analytics to monitor performance and make informed decisions at BuildStrong Academy. This
experience will enable me to contribute to Reebelo’s efforts in data monitoring and analysis to
improve operational performance.
E-commerce
My experience in the e-commerce sector includes optimizing online customer interactions
and enhancing the digital user experience. At BuildStrong Academy, I boosted online training
enrollment through targeted digital marketing efforts. I can bring this expertise to Reebelo’s

POSITION TITLE: OPERATIONS MANAGER
R&R: The rest of our lives
P.O. Box 5473
Richmond, CA 94805
Dear Ms. Rachel Zieleniec:
I am thrilled to apply for the Operations Manager position at R&R. With over 18 years of experience in
operations management and a proven track record of implementing innovative solutions in nonprofit
and non-governmental organizations, I bring a unique blend of expertise and leadership to the table.
However, beyond my professional qualifications, what truly excites me about this opportunity is R&R’s
mission to honor people, experiences, and the unique challenges of the social change sector. I have
personally confronted the detrimental effects of ‘grind’ culture in the nonprofit sector, as well as the
transformative power of rest and rejuvenation. As someone deeply motivated by the movement to
revolutionize the workplace, I am committed to fostering environments where employees feel valued
and supported. I invite you to contact my references, especially my direct reports from the past decade,
to hear firsthand about the sustainable, strategic, and creative work environments I have cultivated,
which align with R&R’s visionary approach.
Inspired by CEO Josh Feldman’s reflections on leadership and organizational growth, I would like to
present examples that demonstrate how I can add significant value to R&R and help achieve its goals in
this new role for R&R:
1. Streamlining Operations for Enhanced Efficiency: R&R's commitment to quality and innovation is
evident, but even the best operations benefit from continuous improvement. At Strings Music Festival, I
developed custom App Scripts using Google Sheets to automate routine tasks, increasing operational
efficiency by 30%. At R&R, I would conduct a thorough audit of current processes, identify bottlenecks,
and introduce streamlined workflows, potentially reducing operational costs significantly while
maintaining R&R's high standards.
2. Leveraging Technology for Data-Driven Decision Making: To remain laser focused on our mission,
leveraging data effectively is crucial for reflection and turning experiences into education. If one does
not exist, I would propose the creation of an advanced Customer Relationship Management (CRM)
platform designed to capture all data points stemming from grantees, funders, and other key inputs. As
the adage goes, "you can’t improve what you don’t measure."
At BuildStrong Academy, I led the organization through a robust data-driven operations
transformation. I collaborated closely with a third-party impact evaluation consultancy to articulate our
theory of change and worked alongside our team to map out a comprehensive infrastructure to collect,
analyze, and use data to enhance operations and programming. This new system generated data that
paved the way to tailored virtual dashboards displaying relevant information—such as progress towards
organizational metrics and fundraising goals—depending on the audience, whether it was the Board of
Directors, the Executive Director, external funders, or specific team segments. In my first year at R&R, I
will lean on this experience to develop and utilize a virtual dashboard to track the organization’s goals,
progress, and impact, thereby enhancing transparency and efficiency.
Moreover, this approach led to a significant increase in productivity, allowing staff to focus on
higher-value activities and enhancing data analysis and predictive capabilities. Implementing similar
technologies at R&R can provide deeper insights into grantee, funder, and consultant behavior. This
enhanced data analysis and predictive capability could result in upwards of 15% cost savings in
productivity, as sta􀇖 spend less time on data entry and more on strategic activities.
3. Enhancing Talent & Culture: Guided by CEO Josh Feldman’s focus on reflection and continuous
learning, I would implement regular feedback loops and reflection sessions within the R&R team. These
sessions would enable us to continuously improve processes and to actively check in with the team. At
Strings Music Festival, I led sta􀇖 meetings with structured agendas, open communication, and
recognition of achievements, fostering a culture of appreciation and accountability. Similarly, for R&R, I
would develop programs focused on upskilling employees and fostering continuous learning and
collaboration. Establishing mentorship opportunities, professional development workshops, and clear
career progression pathways will boost employee engagement and retention, leading to a more
motivated and productive workforce.
In my previous roles, I developed and implemented team-building initiatives that strengthened
collaboration and fostered a cohesive, high-performing workforce. For example, as Program Operations
Advisor in the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), I led activities such as peer
mentorship programs and facilitated open forums for sta􀇖 to share their experiences and insights. I
also empowered junior team members at USAID by delegating significant project responsibilities and
providing them with the necessary support and guidance. This approach not only enhanced their skills
and confidence, but also contributed to a more dynamic and resilient team. At R&R, I would bring
similar initiatives tailored to the unique needs of the team, emphasizing the importance of rejuvenation
through rest and shifting away from the 'grind culture'. By fostering a culture that values rest, reflection,
and shared leadership, we can build a strong organizational culture aligned with R&R's mission.
4. Supporting Financial and Development Systems: With a strong background in financial management,
I excel in managing budgets and conducting detailed financial analyses. I have successfully managed
grants totaling $2.5M and developed financial models to enhance organizational performance. At
BuildStrong Academy, I streamlined budget processes and improved financial forecasting accuracy,
reducing financial discrepancies by 15%. Additionally, my experience in building and managing
websites and developing robust e-commerce tools integrated with accounting systems has improved
accounts receivable and ensured timely accounts payable. This expertise will support R&R's financial
and development systems, ensuring smooth and e􀇗cient operations.
These strategic initiatives and accomplishments demonstrate my ability to enhance financial e􀇗ciency,
implement e􀇖ective information systems, honor and execute fiduciary duties, develop impactful
programs, and build strong talent systems, all of which are critical for the Operations Manager role at
R&R. Embracing a people-first culture, I am excited to contribute to R&R’s joyful, supportive, and
growth-positive environment. The opportunity to grow both professionally and personally, along with
the comprehensive benefits provided by R&R, makes this role an ideal fit for me. I look forward to the
possibility of contributing to R&R’s innovative mission and supporting the organization's continued
success.
Sincerely,
Roberto Hernández

POSITION TITLE: OPERATIONS TRAINING MANAGER
Woodward, Inc.
1081 Woodward Way
Fort Collins, CO 80524
Dear Mr. Randy Hobbs:
I am eager to apply for the Operations Training Manager position at Woodward. With over 18 years of
experience in operations management and a strong track record in developing and delivering innovative
training solutions, I am confident in my ability to support Woodward's mission of pioneering energy control
solutions through an effective onboarding and training infrastructure. My experience in managing complex
technical training programs and commitment to fostering standardization and consistency align with
Woodward's recent organizational enhancements aimed at simplifying operations and increasing profitability.
Woodward’s leadership in aerospace and industrial technologies resonates with my passion for driving
innovation and operational excellence, and I am inspired by its commitment to shaping a sustainable future.
When Chip Blankenship, Woodward’s Chairman of the Board and CEO, recently discussed the company's
technical capabilities, robust customer relationships, and innovative contributions to the aerospace and
industrial markets, he highlighted Woodward’s pivotal role in driving decarbonization and shaping a sustainable
future through technological innovation. His dedication to serving customers, developing team members, and
enhancing business outcomes aligns perfectly with my professional values and aspirations, fueling my
enthusiasm to contribute to Woodward’s ongoing success in these critical areas:
1. Training Program Management and Delivery: During my tenure at the Innovation Lab, I managed the launch
and successful operation of a comprehensive technical training program from the ground up, ultimately serving
over 1,000 stakeholders within the first two years. I established and refined the curriculum and leveraged
project management expertise to coordinate multiple services—including primarily business consulting, career
and computer training, and financial literacy workshops—and ensure seamless delivery tailored to the target
audience's needs and investors' desired outcomes.
Additionally, as a Program Operations Advisor at the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), I
successfully developed and implemented a comprehensive onboarding program for new team members before
their high-risk assignments in Afghanistan and Pakistan. I designed and improved the onboarding curriculum,
coordinated various training modules to meet federal government guidelines, and ensured seamless content
delivery tailored to the geopolitical context while remaining focused on the agency’s needs. I managed the
entire training lifecycle, from content creation to execution and evaluation, by employing superior project
management techniques. This included using tools like Microsoft Project and Trello to plan and track progress,
ensuring that all training initiatives were delivered on time and within scope. I also utilized Agile methodologies
to continuously assess and update the program, allowing for iterative improvements aligned with evolving
organizational goals. Additionally, I oversaw offline skills training, managed training equipment, and coordinated
with cross-functional teams to ensure seamless execution and alignment with company objectives.
These experiences have honed my ability to manage comprehensive training programs, such as Woodward's
Operations Foundational Onboarding Program, ensuring it meets the highest standards of efficiency and
effectiveness.
How I Will Add Value to Woodward: I will leverage my extensive experience to enhance the customization and
delivery of training modules tailored to the specific needs of Woodward’s departments, ensuring alignment with
organizational goals and employee development. One of my key achievements at the Colorado Homebuilding
Academy was leading the customization and deployment of Zoho, a project management tool that significantly
increased communication, collaboration, and standardization across our training programs. This tool enabled
the entire operation to stay organized, ensuring that all training initiatives were meticulously planned, executed,
and evaluated, leading to greater efficiency and alignment with organizational goals. My ability to oversee and
streamline diverse training initiatives through superior project management ensures that employees at
Woodward will receive the necessary skills and knowledge to excel. By fostering a culture of continuous
learning and development, I am confident I can contribute to Woodward’s mission of driving innovation and
operational excellence across the aerospace and industrial markets.
2. Standardization and Consistency in Training: At BuildStrong Academy of Colorado, I developed and
implemented standardized processes to ensure consistent training assessment, design, and delivery across our
construction training programs. Utilizing competency models issued by the U.S. Department of Labor and the
National Association of Home Builders, I established a framework that maintained consistency in training
outcomes across our various workforce development programs, including college-level, high school, and adult
vocational training. This standardization was crucial not only in ensuring that all training materials were regularly
updated, communicated effectively, and retained in a standardized format, but also in achieving measurable
results. For instance, our standardized approach contributed to maintaining a record of zero injuries during
construction training sessions, significantly boosting the program’s reputation for safety and effectiveness. This
accomplishment aligns with Woodward’s goal of driving consistent, high-quality training practices across the
production organization.
How I Will Add Value to Woodward: I will bring my expertise in standardization to Woodward by implementing
consistent training protocols and materials, ensuring every employee, regardless of location, receives topquality,
standardized training. For instance, based on my experience introducing innovations into the training
program at BuildStrong Academy of Colorado, I will explore unique tools for making the Woodward training
program effective, accessible, and best-in-class. At BuildStrong Academy of Colorado, I introduced and
implemented virtual reality (VR) technology to ensure the continuity of training operations during the COVID-19
pandemic. Students were able to continue “hands-on” training in the safety of their own homes, avoiding
workforce pipeline delays in a delicate moment of global economic crisis. Through rapid feedback loops from
trainees and instructors, I was able to deploy this tool, enhance the trainee experience, and maintain progress
toward organizational goals while fostering a culture of continuous improvement.
3. Guidance and Recommendation for Training Levels: At the Innovation Lab, I provided tailored training and
coaching to individuals at various stages of their career and business development journeys. This involved
assessing each participant’s needs and recommending appropriate training pathways to ensure they received
the most relevant and effective instruction. At BuildStrong Academy of Colorado, I worked closely with the COO
of Oakwood Homes, our primary homebuilder, and the President/CEO of Precision Building Systems. Based on
their construction and hiring needs, I collaborated with colleagues to develop tailored recommendations to
leadership and staff, including floor managers and construction leads, about the specific training required to
match those needs. This collaborative approach ensured that training programs were precisely tailored to meet
the workforce's needs and aligned with organizational goals, effectively equipping team members with the
necessary skills for their roles.
How I Will Add Value to Woodward: I can apply this experience to Woodward by developing a tiered training
program that provides guidance and recommendations for employees at different stages of their career
development. By assessing employees’ current skill levels and career aspirations, I can create personalized
training plans that help them progress to higher levels of expertise and responsibility. This approach will
enhance individual career development and contribute to the company's overall talent growth and retention.
4. Cross-Training and Continuous Improvement: At the BuildStrong Academy of Colorado, I played a pivotal
role in creating and implementing effective cross-training programs. By fostering a culture of continuous
improvement, I ensured that employees and students were exposed to various aspects of the construction
industry, broadening their skill sets and improving overall program outcomes. For instance, I spearheaded
initiatives that encouraged students to participate in the Construction Skills Bootcamp and the Construction
Management program. This comprehensive approach provided a thorough understanding of the industry's
practical and managerial aspects, leading to higher retention rates and better job placement outcomes.
How I Could Add Value to Woodward: I can apply this experience to Woodward by developing cross-training
programs that enhance employees' versatility and adaptability. I can help Woodward create a more agile and
resilient workforce by promoting continuous improvement and cross-functional training. This will improve
individual performance and drive operational excellence and innovation across the company.
In summary, my extensive experience in training program management, standardization, tailored guidance, and
continuous improvement aligns perfectly with Woodward’s objectives for the Operations Training Manager role.
I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to Woodward’s mission and drive impactful results through
innovative and effective training strategies.
Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to discuss how my skills, experience, and commitment to
excellence can contribute to Woodward’s ongoing success.
Sincerely,
Roberto Hernández

Open Philanthropy
Ms. Paige Henchen
Manager, Talent Acquisition
182 Howard St. #225
San Francisco, CA 94105
Dear Ms. Henchen,
I am excited to apply for the Recruiter position at Open Philanthropy. With over 18 years of
experience across operations management, recruitment, and program development, I am
confident in my ability to contribute to Open Philanthropy’s mission of maximizing global
impact through strategic giving and transparent knowledge sharing. My career has been
driven by a commitment to mission-driven work across diverse sectors, from supporting the
arts and youth education at Strings Music to driving economic empowerment and small
business development at the Innovation Lab. This alignment with Open Philanthropy’s values
motivates me to bring my expertise in round management, process optimization, and
candidate relationship management to your team.
1. Project Management and Round Management:
In my role as Director of Operations at Strings Music, I coordinated multiple recruitment
rounds simultaneously to address high turnover in technical and event production teams.
Given the unique challenges of operating in a resort community and managing the
pressures of the pandemic, I designed and implemented a structured recruitment system
from scratch. This included digitizing job descriptions, standardizing interview questions,
and introducing interview scorecards, which resulted in faster, more consistent hiring
decisions. Managing these processes while balancing ongoing operational demands
reflects my ability to coordinate and oversee recruitment rounds at different stages—
essential skills for the Recruiter role at Open Philanthropy.
2. Designed Evaluation Steps:
As Program Operations Advisor at USAID, I was responsible for designing rigorous
evaluation steps to recruit for roles in high-stakes environments like Afghanistan and
Pakistan. I developed scenario-based assessments and situational judgment tests tailored
to the specific challenges of these regions. Additionally, I standardized interview processes
across multiple stakeholders by implementing scoring rubrics and guidelines that ensured
fairness and consistency. My experience in designing evaluation steps that align with both
technical requirements and organizational values directly corresponds to Open
Philanthropy’s emphasis on high-quality, structured hiring processes.
3. Infrastructure and Back-End Systems:
At BuildStrong Academy, I recognized an opportunity to overhaul our recruitment tracking
and stakeholder engagement by building a custom CRM from scratch. Without waiting for
executive approval, I led the development of a system that integrated lead tracking,
pipeline management, and automated reporting. This CRM transformed our operations by
streamlining communication, improving data tracking, and allowing real-time visibility into
our recruitment pipeline. Additionally, at Strings Music, I implemented a digital project
management tool that centralized event scheduling, resource allocation, and task tracking
across departments, significantly enhancing operational efficiency. These experiences in
optimizing infrastructure and back-end systems align with Open Philanthropy’s commitment
to maintaining robust applicant tracking and process automation.
4. Candidate Evaluation and Relationship Management:
In all of my leadership roles, I have been directly involved in evaluating candidates and
managing relationships throughout the recruitment process. At the Innovation Lab, my
hands-on approach to recruitment allowed me to carefully screen candidates, leveraging
the input of trusted colleagues to create a more inclusive and democratic hiring process. I
have always prioritized making candidates feel supported and valued throughout the
recruitment experience, as I understand that a positive, respectful interaction not only
reflects well on the organization but also ensures that candidates are fully engaged. This
approach was particularly critical given our limited resources and the need to build a team
aligned with our mission. My experience in fostering strong candidate relationships,
coupled with my belief that recruitment is as much about building rapport as it is about
assessing skills, positions me well to represent Open Philanthropy and contribute to
thoughtful, mission-aligned hiring decisions.
5. Process Optimization and Iterative Improvements:
At BuildStrong Academy, I led process optimization initiatives that reduced time-to-hire and
improved candidate satisfaction by 30%. At Strings Music, I introduced a cloud-based
system that streamlined reporting and financial management, allowing for more accurate
budget tracking and better decision-making. My commitment to continuous improvement
and the ability to implement solutions that drive efficiency are qualities that resonate with
Open Philanthropy’s focus on refining recruitment processes and exploring innovative
workflow improvements.
6. Adaptability and Flexibility in a Rapidly Growing Organization:
Launching and scaling the Innovation Lab required significant adaptability, particularly as
our service offerings evolved in response to community needs. By applying lean project
management methodologies, I was able to pivot quickly, adjust strategies, and guide the
Lab’s exponential growth—serving over 1,000 participants annually within two years.
Similarly, my work in the Peace Corps, where I supported a dairy cooperative in Paraguay’s
challenging environment, further sharpened my adaptability and resourcefulness. These
experiences reflect my ability to thrive in dynamic, rapidly growing environments, directly
aligning with Open Philanthropy’s needs.
In summary, my extensive experience in round management, recruitment, process
optimization, and mission-driven work positions me well to contribute to Open Philanthropy’s
objectives. I am eager to apply my skills in support of your mission and look forward to
discussing how I can add value to your team.
Sincerely,
Roberto Hernández

POSITION TITLE: ASSISTANT VICE PRESIDENT OF FACILITIES OPERATIONS
Colorado State University
University Operations Division
Ms. Rachel Richardson
711 Oval Dr.
Fort Collins, CO 80521
Dear Ms. Richardson,
I am writing to express my interest in the Associate Vice President of Facilities Operations
position at Colorado State University. With over a decade of progressive experience in
facilities operations, vendor management, and construction services, I am confident I can
contribute to CSU’s strategic objectives and long-term success. My leadership has been
instrumental in large-scale remodels, construction projects, operational management, and
strategic planning, consistently aligning with institutional goals and delivering results.
At BuildStrong Academy, Oakwood Homes’ premier training organization, I played a pivotal
role in operations, vendor, and facilities management, directly contributing to the
organization's growth. My expertise attracted the attention of outside investors and
franchise experts, who sought to glean best practices to implement similar facilities across
the country. This experience within a construction-centric organization underscores my deep
understanding of remodeling and construction services, making me uniquely suited to lead
CSU’s operations in this area.
In my career, I have successfully and ethically managed a wide range of budgets, from
$250K seed capital to launch the Innovation Lab to a $3.6M operational budget for
BuildStrong Academy. While I have not yet overseen a budget at the scale of CSU’s $775
million construction projects, I am confident that the principles and practices I have applied
in managing smaller multimillion-dollar operations and facilities budgets would translate
effectively to larger financial responsibilities. I recognize the importance of strategic
financial management, especially in dynamic environments like CSU, where a new budget
model is being implemented to prioritize the university’s mission areas and support growth
in higher education. My approach to budgeting involves a commitment to data-driven
decision-making, financial transparency, and adaptability—values that align with CSU’s
evolving financial landscape.
To ensure accurate financial tracking, I have consistently invested in data tracking and
project management tools, allowing for careful monitoring of all aspects of facility or
campus-wide projects. I prioritize timely vendor invoicing and thorough reconciliations to
maintain financial accuracy, while conducting quarterly strategy sessions to align our budget
with long-term strategic goals. This approach enables me to make critical pivots when
needed, ensuring both operational efficiency and smart spending. I am confident that my
financial management skills would be an asset as CSU continues to evolve its budgeting
processes to enhance fiscal responsibility and strategic investment.
In addition, my tenure as Director of Operations at Strings included the oversight of a $2
million remodel of a 650+ seat pavilion, featuring structural upgrades such as added ADU
capacity, new railings, new front entrance vestibule, flooring, and a sound system overhaul.
This project, coupled with my extensive facilities and vendor management experience, has
equipped me to handle the construction and facility management complexities that the
University Operations at CSU come across daily.
Beyond my technical skills, my success throughout my career would not have been possible
without my focus on building and maintaining relationships. Whether presenting to senior
executives at Oakwood Homes, Home Builders Institute, or Berkshire Hathaway—who later
acquired the homebuilder I worked for—or mentoring my direct reports, I have prioritized
clear communication, trust, and respect. These same relationship-building skills extend to
the vendors I’ve worked with, where rapport and mutual respect have been critical in
ensuring smooth project execution.
I will take my Project Management Professional (PMP) certification exam within the next
month to further enhance my project management capabilities. This certification will
complement my extensive hands-on experience and allow me to apply the latest project
management methodologies to drive operational efficiency and project success further.
I am also deeply committed to fostering a collaborative and inclusive environment. As a
leader, I have always emphasized the importance of diversity and equity, ensuring that
every team member's voice is valued. I strive to mentor and guide my teams toward
success, much as I would at Colorado State University, where I see a great opportunity to
advance your facilities management goals.
I am excited about the possibility of bringing my construction services expertise, operational
leadership, and relationship-building focus to CSU. Thank you for considering my
application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss further how I can contribute to the
continued success and growth of your facilities management division.
Sincerely,
Roberto Hernández

programs that have significantly enhanced organizational efficiency. For example, as Director
of Operations at Strings Music, I modernized the company’s hiring process, creating a
structured recruitment system that reduced turnover, streamlined onboarding, and allowed
us to recruit 40 new hires during my tenure. I also revamped the employee manual in
collaboration with HR experts to ensure compliance and foster a culture of transparency and
inclusion.
In addition, my role at BuildStrong Academy saw me lead the development of a custom CRM
system that optimized our recruitment pipeline and improved data tracking. This system
reduced our time-to-hire by 30% while boosting candidate satisfaction and reducing manual
inefficiencies. I am confident that my proactive approach to developing cross-functional
systems would support Personified’s continued growth and help ensure operational health
across your teams.
I am deeply aligned with Personified’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and I

1800 Massachusetts Ave NW, 6th FL,
Washington, DC 20036
Dear Ms. Sanchez,
I am excited to submit my application for the Operations Director position at Poder Latinx.
With over 18 years of experience in operations management, human resources, and
financial oversight, I bring a wealth of expertise in building strong operational foundations
for nonprofits and advocacy organizations. Poder Latinx’s mission to empower the Latinx
community through political engagement, social justice, and leadership development deeply
resonates with me, both personally and professionally. As a bilingual and bicultural firstgeneration
American with Colombian roots, I am particularly motivated by the opportunity
to contribute to this critical work, ensuring that the Latinx community has the resources and
support needed to make lasting change.
Throughout my career, I have developed and implemented HR systems and operational
processes that align with the needs of dynamic, mission-driven organizations. At Strings
Music, I led the revamp of our recruitment and onboarding processes, addressing high
turnover and standardizing hiring practices through digitized job descriptions, structured
interviews, and performance metrics. I recruited and onboarded over 40 new employees,
ensuring that each new hire received the support and guidance necessary for success.
Additionally, I managed compensation audits and collaborated with leadership on salary
administration, ensuring equity and market competitiveness. I also played a critical role in
overhauling performance management, implementing consistent feedback processes,
performance improvement plans (PIPs), and staff development programs.
In terms of organizational infrastructure, my experience at BuildStrong Academy involved
leading strategic planning initiatives that integrated HR, finance, and operations, ensuring
alignment with long-term organizational goals. I successfully implemented technology
platforms that streamlined administrative processes, improving overall efficiency and
enhancing team collaboration. These efforts enabled our teams to operate seamlessly
across multiple regions, which aligns well with Poder Latinx's national presence. I am
confident that I can contribute to continuous improvement of operational and financial
systems while addressing both current and future infrastructure needs at Poder Latinx.
When it comes to Operations and Finance Administration, I have a strong background in
leading the annual budgeting process, working closely with leadership to provide accurate,
timely financial information. At BuildStrong Academy, I implemented financial tools that
allowed for real-time tracking of expenses, vendor payments, and budgeting, resulting in
greater financial transparency and efficiency. I have also managed complex financial
structures, including 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) entities, ensuring compliance and proper
oversight of multiple funding streams. My ability to collaborate with fiscal sponsors and
external vendors further ensures that day-to-day financial operations run smoothly, from
contract management to reimbursements.
In addition to HR and finance, I am well-versed in compliance and legal requirements across
multiple states, having ensured employment law adherence and programmatic compliance
in past roles. This experience has prepared me to manage the compliance landscape for
Poder Latinx across its various programmatic and operational functions.
The opportunity to work with an organization that shares my values and is committed to
strengthening the political power of the Latinx community is incredibly meaningful to me. I
am eager to bring my skills, experience, and bilingual abilities to Poder Latinx to support its
growth and success. I would love the chance to discuss how I can contribute to your
mission and help sustain the impactful work you are doing.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute
to Poder Latinx’s important work.

Empower Work
Founder & Executive Director
Jaime-Alexis Fowler
San Francisco, CA 94117
Dear Ms. Fowler:
I am excited to apply for the Partnerships Lead position at Empower Work. With over 18 years
of experience in operations and partnership management—particularly in nonprofit and
workforce development settings—I bring a wealth of expertise in building strong, impactdriven
partnerships. Empower Work’s mission to create healthy, equitable workplaces where
individuals are valued and supported deeply resonates with my personal and professional
values. I am eager to contribute my skills to help scale Empower Work’s impact and ensure
that millions of workers across the U.S. have the tools to thrive.
I had the pleasure of connecting with Cindy Elby, who is familiar with Empower Work from its
early days scaling under Uncharted’s support. Cindy shared with me that although her
engagement with the organization was a few years ago, she was impressed by the work
Empower Work was doing and its mission to support workers through scalable tech-driven
solutions. I’m grateful to have her endorsement as someone who appreciated the important
work Empower Work was doing, and I believe this further emphasizes my enthusiasm for
joining your team.
Throughout my career, I have consistently sought out opportunities that allow me to
empower marginalized communities. At BuildStrong Academy, I led our operations team in
implementing workforce development programs aimed at training individuals for careers in
construction and the corresponding trades. One of my proudest accomplishments was
establishing a scalable operations ecosystem that allowed us to franchise our construction
trades workforce program. By developing and duplicating standard operating procedures
(SOPs), I ensured future franchisees could seamlessly implement the program and expand
our impact. This process led to a successful launch in multiple regions and positioned us for
future growth across 10 regions by 2025. This accomplishment reflects my ability to scale
successful initiatives—skills I am eager to bring to the Partnerships Lead role at Empower
Work.
What excites me most about this opportunity is the chance to build and expand partnerships
that directly impact workers who need it most. Empower Work’s approach to addressing
economic security, emotional well-being, and workplace equity aligns perfectly with my
passion for combining strategic thinking and human-centered service. In my roles at
BuildStrong Academy and the Innovation Lab, I thrived on developing partnerships that not
only addressed immediate needs but also created sustainable, long-term outcomes. I believe
in the power of partnerships to create lasting change, and I am eager to leverage my
experience to help Empower Work scale its reach and deepen its impact.
In addition to my experience, I bring a genuine love for connecting with people and building
relationships based on trust and shared goals. As an extrovert, I thrive in environments where
I can collaborate with others, listen to their needs, and work together to build innovative
solutions. I am confident that my skills, combined with my passion for Empower Work’s
mission, make me a strong fit for the Partnerships Lead role.
Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the possibility of contributing to
Empower Work’s mission and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experience
aligns with your goals. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Janiece L. Williams
Co-Founder & Executive Director
LeaderFlow
janiece@leaderflow.org
Dear Ms. Williams,
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Director of Operations position at
LeaderFlow. With over 18 years of experience in nonprofit management, operations, and
workforce development, including significant roles in financial oversight, program logistics,
and diversity initiatives, I believe my extensive background positions me as an ideal
candidate to support LeaderFlow’s mission of empowering professionals of color within the
Architecture, Engineering, and Construction (AEC) industry.
Operations Management and Process Improvement
At BuildStrong Academy of Colorado, I led operations and oversaw workforce development
programs, particularly focused on increasing access to career paths for underrepresented
groups such as people of color, veterans, and women. My efforts ensured that our
construction workforce programs not only ran efficiently but that they also fostered an
inclusive environment—aligning perfectly with LeaderFlow's emphasis on diversity and
inclusion within the AEC industry.
In this role, I successfully managed multiple vendor contracts and third-party service
providers, negotiated favorable terms, and ensured that all stakeholders aligned with our
diversity goals. I developed and implemented operational policies that streamlined workflows
and improved our technology integration, resulting in a 20% improvement in program
efficiency. I can bring this same forward-thinking operational leadership to LeaderFlow as you
continue to expand your programming across multiple cities.
Financial Management and Accountability
I have extensive experience in financial management, budgeting, and fiscal oversight. During
my time as Director of Operations at Strings Music Festival, I managed the organization’s $5
million annual budget. I worked closely with leadership to ensure transparency in financial
reporting and compliance with budgetary guidelines. My efforts resulted in a 15% reduction in
operational costs over two years through the strategic optimization of resources and vendor
negotiations. I also collaborated with accountants to oversee payroll, accounts payable, and
receivable, ensuring that our financial systems remained efficient and aligned with broader
organizational goals.
At LeaderFlow, I am confident I can take on the financial management responsibilities
required for this role, ensuring both fiscal responsibility and growth through the careful
monitoring of financial performance and budget adherence.
Leadership Program Management and KPI Tracking
A critical component of my role at BuildStrong Academy was overseeing the logistics and
successful implementation of leadership development programs. I tracked and analyzed key
performance indicators (KPIs) to measure the success of our programs, using this data to
inform strategic decisions and to continuously improve outcomes. By leveraging these
insights, I was able to guide the organization in scaling its programs, enabling us to increase
participation from underrepresented groups by 25% within the first year.
I look forward to bringing this experience to LeaderFlow, where I can manage and optimize
the logistics for your leadership development programs across cities. By using data-driven
approaches, I will ensure that we are continually improving program outcomes and driving
forward LeaderFlow’s mission.
Fundraising, Sponsor Relations, and Strategic Partnerships
Fundraising and sponsor relations have been key components of my career, and I am excited
by the opportunity to actively contribute to LeaderFlow’s fundraising initiatives. During my
time at Strings Music Festival, I played a pivotal role in building relationships with key
sponsors and securing over $250,000 in donations to support our programmatic growth. I
worked closely with our Executive Director to develop strategic plans for sponsor
engagement, ensuring that we met both short- and long-term fundraising goals.
Additionally, my work in alumni engagement and community building has been instrumental
in cultivating long-term partnerships. I have represented organizations at industry events,
delivering impactful presentations and networking with potential supporters—skills that I am
eager to apply at LeaderFlow to expand your reach and visibility in the AEC industry.
Social Media Strategy and Content Creation
In addition to my operational and program management experience, I have led social media
and content creation initiatives that boosted organizational visibility and engagement. At
BuildStrong Academy, I developed and executed a comprehensive social media strategy that
increased engagement by 30%, helping us attract a broader audience and secure additional
sponsorships.
I am excited about the prospect of leading LeaderFlow’s social media strategy to help
expand your reach and enhance your leadership program’s visibility. By leveraging my
experience in digital engagement, I am confident I can contribute meaningfully to
LeaderFlow’s online presence and community-building efforts.
LeaderFlow’s mission to build a more inclusive and equitable AEC industry resonates deeply
with my own values and professional experiences. Throughout my career, I have been
committed to fostering diversity and inclusion through workforce development, operational
excellence, and leadership empowerment. My 18+ years of experience in operations
management, financial oversight, program logistics, and fundraising make me uniquely
qualified to take on the Director of Operations role at LeaderFlow.
I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my expertise aligns with your organization’s
goals. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of
contributing to LeaderFlow’s continued success and impact in the AEC industry.

Dear Mr. Bonsey,
I am excited to apply for the Director of Operations position at The ImPact. With over 18 years
of operations management experience across nonprofit and advocacy sectors, I have
consistently delivered operational excellence while supporting diverse teams in various
capacities. I am confident that my background in finance, people operations, and legal
compliance, combined with my leadership skills and global perspective, make me an ideal fit
for this role.
In my most recent role as Director of Operations at Strings Music Festival, I led the
organization’s operations division, overseeing financial management, vendor relations, and
people operations. I developed and executed financial strategies that streamlined budgeting
processes, managed payroll and benefits, and ensured timely audits. My ability to manage
complex budgets, including a $2 million facility remodel, equipped me to take on financial
responsibilities similar to those described in your position.
Leadership, Team, and Operational Management
I have a strong track record of providing leadership and support to operational teams. At
BuildStrong Academy, I oversaw vendor management and internal systems, ensuring
compliance with policies and regulations. I also worked closely with cross-functional teams to
align operational strategies with organizational goals, ensuring smooth collaboration and
system efficiency—experiences that mirror the leadership and operational oversight
responsibilities required at The ImPact.
Financial Management
I have substantial experience developing financial strategies and managing budgets. At
BuildStrong Academy, I managed multimillion-dollar budgets, implemented forward-looking
financial models, and ensured compliance with financial reporting standards. My ability to
lead annual budgeting processes and financial planning aligns with The ImPact’s need for
strong financial oversight. Additionally, I have supported nonprofit initiatives that operate
under fiscal sponsorship models, working to ensure financial accuracy, accountability, and
regulatory compliance for both direct operations and sponsored initiatives.
Legal Compliance and Risk Management
I have extensive experience managing complex legal and regulatory transitions. At
BuildStrong Academy, I guided the organization through the decoupling process from the
Colorado Nonprofit Development Center (CNDC), leading the Academy to achieve
independent 501(c)(3) status. This involved drafting bylaws, coordinating with legal advisors
to ensure compliance with state and federal regulations, and establishing a board of directors
to meet governance standards. At Strings Music Festival, I supervised contract negotiations,
ensured compliance with employment laws, and worked closely with external legal counsel
to address various organizational matters, from contractual obligations to risk mitigation
strategies. These experiences have equipped me with a sophisticated understanding of legal
compliance and risk management, which I am eager to apply to managing The ImPact's legal
risks and contracts.
People Operations
As a hands-on leader, I have extensive experience in people operations, including hiring,
compensation, and team management. I revamped the recruitment and onboarding process
at Strings, fostering a more inclusive and efficient team culture. My experience with hiring
across regions and managing compliance with employment regulations will enable me to
effectively support The ImPact’s globally distributed team.
Internal Systems and Operations
My approach to internal systems has always focused on enhancing operational efficiency. At
BuildStrong Academy, I spearheaded the implementation of technology platforms that
streamlined administrative processes and aligned with organizational goals. I look forward to
bringing this strategic oversight to The ImPact’s internal systems.
Board Relations
I have regularly worked with boards of directors, presenting financial reports and strategic
recommendations. At Strings, I managed board communications related to financial planning
and project updates, collaborating with leadership to ensure transparency and strategic
alignment. I am eager to bring this experience to The ImPact’s finance committee and
broader board relations.
I am enthusiastic about contributing to The ImPact’s mission of driving positive change
through impactful investments. My experience in nonprofit operations, combined with my
leadership and global perspective, makes me well-equipped to oversee your operations
division. I would love to further discuss how my skills and experience can help advance The
ImPact’s mission.

your team.

Dear Mr. Johnston:
I am writing to express my interest in the Associate Director of Economic Development

workforce development, program strategy, and community building, I am enthusiastic
about the opportunity to help shape Larimer County's business landscape and foster

the responsibilities of this role, particularly in securing a skilled and diverse workforce
and driving business expansion efforts.
Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a passion for removing barriers to

development in the Northeast Park Hill community. Within two years, my team and I
served over 1,000 participants annually, providing essential business and career
services, leading to the creation of 11 new businesses and generating over $112,000 in

biggest challenges, I am drawn to Marvel Fusion's mission of developing clean, safe, and
abundant energy through pioneering nuclear fusion technology. It would be an honor to
contribute to such a purpose-driven organization that is on the forefront of the global energy
transition.
With over ten years of operations management experience, I bring a proven ability to build

and managing cross-functional teams. I thrive in start-up and dynamic environments where
growth is a constant, and Marvel Fusion's ambitious pursuit of unlocking the potential of

seamless coordination of operations that are fundamental to achieving breakthroughs in
high-power laser facilities.
In the role of Operations Manager, I am prepared to lead all aspects of daily operations for
Marvel Fusion Inc., from implementing processes and managing office budgets to
coordinating strategic projects with stakeholders. I understand the importance of acting as

POSITION TITLE: OPERATIONS MANAGER
Monday Morning Consultants
Erica Nicole Smith
Dear Ms. Griffin:
My role as Operations Manager and Small Business Consultant at the Innovation Lab in
Northeast Park Hill, Denver, between 2013 and 2016, was a defining professional experience.
The Innovation Lab, funded by major grant donors Piton and Anschutz Family Foundation,
and the parent organization Mi Casa Resource Center, aimed to empower Latino and working
families through economic advancement. As a Latino-oriented nonprofit in a predominantly
African American neighborhood, I prioritized conveying the Lab's vision of community
service. Engaging community leaders in workforce development, churches, schools, and
businesses was essential for success. Leading the startup proved complex, rewarding, and
challenging—transforming the Lab into a thriving community hub was a testament to our
tenacity and commitment to equity.
This experience shaped my approach to operations and is indicative of the commitment I
bring to every project. I believe that the lessons learned from the Innovation Lab resonate
deeply with the mission of Equity in the Center (EiC). With over 18 years of experience in
operations management within nonprofit and start-up environments, I am eager to parlay my
expertise to EiC's mission of shifting mindsets, practices, and systems to center race equity
and build a Race Equity Culture.
In my previous role as Director of Operations at Strings Music Festival, I led the development
and implementation of internal systems that enhanced organizational efficiency and
supported the execution of high-quality events. By establishing Standard Operating
Procedures (SOPs) and optimizing workflows, I ensured seamless operations that aligned
with the organization's strategic goals. My proactive problem-solving approach and ability to
navigate ambiguity were instrumental in fostering a culture of continuous improvement.
At BuildStrong Academy of Colorado, I spearheaded the design and implementation of
scalable operational frameworks for workforce training programs, addressing community
needs and expanding services into new regions. I managed multimillion-dollar budgets,
implemented forward-looking financial models, and ensured adherence to compliance
standards. My experience in HR administration, financial oversight, and vendor management
aligns closely with the responsibilities outlined for the Operations Manager role at EiC.
I am particularly drawn to EiC's commitment to building a Race Equity
Culture and operationalizing equity across all aspects of organizational practices. My
dedication to anti-racism and social justice is reflected in my efforts to foster inclusive
environments and implement initiatives that align operational functions with race equity
values. Additionally, I am familiar with EiC's Awake to Woke to Work framework and the Race
Equity Cycle, which are vital to transforming organizational culture and driving meaningful
progress towards race equity. I am confident that my background in designing effective
internal systems, managing relationships with external consultants and vendors, and
supporting senior leadership teams will contribute to EiC's growth and sustainability.
I am enthusiastic about the opportunity to work in a remote environment and collaborate with
a team that values authenticity, proactive problem-solving, and a commitment to dismantling
white supremacist workplace norms. My proficiency in Google Workspace, Zoom, Paycom,
Bill.com, and QuickBooks, along with my experience in virtual communication platforms,
positions me well to thrive in this role.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how
my experience and skills align with the goals of Equity in the Center.

POSITION TITLE: DEPUTY DIVISION DIRECTOR OF CENTRALIZED SERVICES
Department of Regulatory Agencies
Alanah Daniels
1560 Broadway
Denver, CO 80202
Dear Ms. Alanah Daniels:
I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Deputy Division Director of Centralized
Services position at the Division of Professions and Occupations (DPO). I am particularly
drawn to DPO's mission of promoting a fair and competitive business environment in
Colorado, and I am eager to contribute to the centralized services team in achieving
regulatory consistency and operational excellence. It would be an honor to serve such a
purpose-driven agency that is committed to consumer protection and enhancing the quality
of professional services in our state.
With over 18 years of operational leadership experience, including high-level management
roles in nonprofit, government, and mission-driven settings, I bring a robust set of skills in
overseeing centralized functions, strategic planning, compliance, and team development.
During my time as Director of Operations at Strings Music Festival and Operations Manager
at BuildStrong Academy of Colorado, I was instrumental in leading multi-site operations,
developing standard operating procedures (SOPs), optimizing workflows, and managing
cross-functional teams to meet organizational objectives. I thrive in environments that
demand strategic oversight, strong stakeholder relationships, and effective compliance with
regulatory standards—qualities I believe align well with the responsibilities of this role.
In my most recent role at Strings Music Festival, I was responsible for overseeing financial
management and resource allocation, aligning operations with long-term goals, and ensuring
adherence to all applicable regulations. By optimizing workflows and enhancing scheduling
efficiency, I was able to achieve annual savings of $50K. Additionally, I have extensive
experience in regulatory compliance—a key aspect of DORA's mission. At BuildStrong
Academy, I managed $2.5M in grants, ensuring compliance with both federal and state
regulations while reducing discrepancies by 15%. I am confident that my experience in
managing centralized resources and supporting compliance initiatives would allow me to
effectively drive the performance of the Centralized Services Unit.
A key responsibility of this role is to oversee all centralized functions of the DPO, and I
believe my background in managing multi-tiered structures will prove invaluable. As
Operations Manager at the Innovation Lab in Denver, I launched an economic development
initiative that served over 1,000 participants annually, expanding community reach by forming
strategic partnerships with local government and nonprofits. My approach to building efficient
and scalable models resulted in a 45% increase in client acquisition. The ability to foster
cross-departmental alignment and create a culture of accountability is an area where I excel,
as evidenced by the successful implementation of key performance indicator (KPI)-driven
approaches during my tenure at BuildStrong Academy.
Additionally, I have hands-on experience in overseeing licensing, ensuring quality customer
service, and implementing consistent and legally compliant processes—all of which are
emphasized in the job description for this role. At USAID, I contributed to operational
readiness in challenging environments by leading organizational assessments and
developing cloud-based project management tools to improve efficiency. These experiences
have honed my skills in strategic decision-making, policy development, and regulatory
compliance, all of which will be critical in supporting the Division's mission.
As the Deputy Director of Centralized Services, I am prepared to lead the centralized services
work unit by providing strategic guidance, ensuring operational consistency, and driving
collaboration between various programs and offices. My experience in change management,
staff development, and resource allocation has equipped me with the tools to support and
enhance team performance effectively. I am particularly inspired by DORA's values of
diversity and inclusion, and I look forward to fostering an environment that reflects and
supports our diverse communities.
Thank you for considering my application. As a Fort Collins resident, I am excited about the
possibility of working in a hybrid environment while actively contributing to the Denver office.
I would be thrilled to further discuss how my operational management experience, strategic
planning expertise, and dedication to regulatory excellence can help the Division of
Professions and Occupations achieve its ambitious goals. I look forward to the opportunity to
bring my passion for operational efficiency and consumer protection to your team.

POSITION TITLE: MANAGER OF LEARNING OPERATIONS
Woodward, Inc.
1081 Woodward Way
Fort Collins, CO 80524
Dear Hiring Manager:
I am excited to apply for the Manager of Learning Operations position at Woodward. With over 18 years of
experience in operations management, training program development, and digital learning innovations, I bring a
proven track record of delivering scalable learning solutions and fostering continuous improvement.
Woodward’s dedication to innovation and leadership in energy control solutions aligns with my passion for
creating impactful learning environments that drive organizational success.
At BuildStrong Academy, I led the development and execution of adaptive learning programs that served over
500 participants annually. By implementing a hybrid model and integrating Learning Management System (LMS)
technology, I enhanced participant engagement and boosted enrollment by 40%. These efforts streamlined
learning delivery and ensured programs were responsive to the evolving needs of our stakeholders, including
private-sector partners in the homebuilding industry.
My experience in digital transformation has been pivotal in optimizing operations and enhancing learning
ecosystems. At Strings Music, I introduced a centralized platform that integrated resource allocation, scheduling,
and training, resulting in improved collaboration across teams and real-time insights for leadership. Similarly, at
USAID, I led the design of onboarding programs for high-stakes international assignments, incorporating
standardized curricula and evaluation tools that met rigorous federal guidelines. This approach ensured
compliance while enhancing team readiness and performance.
I am particularly excited about Woodward’s focus on leveraging digital learning technologies, including AI-driven
tools, to expand and enhance learning operations. My expertise in deploying AI-based analytics and virtual
training platforms equips me to develop data-driven strategies that improve learner outcomes and align with
organizational goals. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, I introduced virtual reality (VR) training
solutions at BuildStrong Academy, enabling participants to continue hands-on learning remotely. This innovation
maintained program continuity and ensured high levels of engagement despite challenging circumstances.
Beyond technical expertise, I thrive in collaborative environments where cross-functional partnerships drive
success. I have consistently built strong relationships with internal teams, external stakeholders, and senior
leadership, fostering a culture of trust and shared purpose. At Mi Casa Resource Center, I launched the
Innovation Lab to deliver wrap-around services, including financial literacy and technology training, to over 300
participants annually. This initiative underscored my ability to align learning operations with broader
organizational missions and community needs.
In addition to my operational and technical capabilities, I am committed to creating inclusive and engaging
learning experiences that empower individuals and drive business results. I believe that Woodward’s emphasis
on innovation and excellence in learning operations offers an ideal platform for my skills and aspirations.
Thank you for considering my application. I am eager to bring my expertise in learning operations, digital
transformation, and strategic leadership to Woodward. I welcome the opportunity to further discuss how I can
contribute to your team’s success.

Hewlett Packard Labs
Vandana Tangri
Chief of Staff
3404 E. Harmony Rd.
Fort Collins, CO 80528
Dear Ms. Vandana Tangri:
I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Operations Manager position at
Hewlett Packard Labs. With over a decade of experience in operations management across
diverse industries, I am eager to bring my skills in compliance management, cross-functional
leadership, and process optimization to Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE). I am inspired by
HPE's mission to drive innovation from edge to cloud, and I am excited about the opportunity
to contribute to an organization committed to shaping the future of technology.
Throughout my career, I have demonstrated my ability to implement effective operational
processes, foster cross-departmental collaboration, and deliver strategic initiatives that drive
organizational efficiency. At BuildStrong Academy of Colorado, I led the operations for
workforce development programs, scaling the program reach to 500 graduates annually
through both in-person and virtual classrooms. This experience has honed my skills in
managing procurement processes, overseeing compliance, and working closely with financial
teams—skills that align closely with the requirements of the Operations Manager role at
Hewlett Packard Labs. Additionally, my work at Strings Music Festival allowed me to direct
logistics for over 100 events annually, optimizing operations and achieving a significant
reduction in costs.
I am particularly drawn to the responsibilities of this role, including managing compliance
programs, overseeing federal invoicing, and streamlining procurement processes. My
background in federal invoicing and compliance with the U.S. Agency for International
Development has equipped me with a strong understanding of working within regulatory
frameworks. I am adept at managing records, ensuring compliance with federal guidelines,
and building strong partnerships with finance and research teams to achieve operational
goals.
Hewlett Packard Labs' culture of innovation and collaboration resonates deeply with me. I
thrive in dynamic environments that value diverse perspectives and continuous improvement.
Employers have consistently noted that I excel in roles that require versatility and
adaptability—where I am not only comfortable wearing multiple hats but thrive the most.
Additionally, I am highly motivated by opportunities to learn new things, which allows me to
expand my knowledge of products, techniques, and operations. This continuous learning
enhances my ability to tackle challenges from various angles and develop effective solutions.
My experience in managing cross-functional teams and implementing operational best
practices would enable me to make an immediate impact on the Labs' governance,
operations, and planning functions. I am a proactive problem-solver who enjoys wearing
multiple hats, and I am excited about the opportunity to support HPE in driving innovation
that benefits both business and society.
Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to further discuss
how my experience in compliance, planning, and operational management can support
Hewlett Packard Labs in achieving its goals. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to
HPE's mission and being part of an environment that is advancing the way people live and
work.

POSITION TITLE: ACCOUNT MANAGER
86 Repairs
Adam Katz
Head of Sales
Chicago, IL
Dear Mr. Adam Katz:
I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Account Manager position at 86
Repairs. I understand that my extensive experience in the nonprofit and government
sectors may initially seem out of alignment with the account manager role; however, each
of the roles I executed in these sectors required skills and experiences that closely align
with your requirements.
Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated a consultative and customercentric
mindset, honed my ability to cultivate high-level relationships, and developed a deep
understanding of the needs of the stakeholders I served. For instance, my role as Director
of Operations at Strings Music Festival involved fostering relationships with participants,
vendors, and staff to deliver a seamless event experience. Similarly, as a Program
Operations Advisor with USAID, I collaborated closely with various partners and vendors to
understand their needs and ensure effective service delivery.
In all of my roles, I was tasked with understanding the socio-economic challenges of
participants or working closely with hundreds of vendors to understand their needs. This
required a consultative approach that resonates with the skills needed for account
management. Additionally, my operations roles were largely customer-facing, which
cultivated my ability to build and grow relationships effectively. My experience working in
nonprofit organizations required me to be highly self-motivated, organized, and capable of
overcoming significant roadblocks. Many of the roles I undertook did not previously exist
within the organizational structure and required a start-up, entrepreneurial spirit to build
something substantive from nothing.
While my direct experience in the restaurant or technology industry may be limited, I am
eager to learn and leverage my transferable skills. In my former role as Director of
Operations at Strings Music Festival, I played a leading role in starting the organization’s
food and beverage operations, which included identifying and implementing a suitable
point-of-sale (POS) system. We decided to implement Yoast, although I was unable to
complete the project due to a housing relocation to Fort Collins, CO. This experience,
however, gave me valuable insight into operational decision-making in a food and beverage
context.
Moreover, I have a demonstrated ability to think strategically, challenge the status quo, and
consistently go beyond the call of duty—traits I believe are essential for success at 86
Repairs. The underfunded nature of nonprofit work often demanded that I wear multiple
hats and manage numerous projects simultaneously. I thrived in this entrepreneurial
environment, which absorbed rapid change and disruption, and I am confident that I can
bring the same energy to 86 Repairs.
I have successfully managed projects, including onboarding new employees and
independent contractors to execute our mission, and am comfortable collecting and
manipulating data to help customers make better operational decisions. In a previous role, I
developed and implemented a CRM from scratch, transforming paperwork into online forms
that fed directly into a centralized system. This allowed me to create various dashboards,
tailored for different audiences, such as the Board of Directors, Executive Director, and
recruiting teams.
Lastly, I am very comfortable working in a remote environment, as I have done so
extensively throughout my career. The culture at 86 Repairs—one that values diverse
experiences, creativity, and rapid change—resonates deeply with me. I am motivated by the
opportunity to support restaurant operators in managing their facilities more effectively,
reducing repair costs, and ensuring a seamless experience for their guests.
Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to further
discuss how my experience in customer management, process improvement, and operations
can support 86 Repairs in achieving its goals. I look forward to potentially contributing to
your team and making a meaningful impact.

POSITION TITLE: DIRECTOR OF PEOPLE & CULTURE
Borealis Philanthropy
Amoretta Morris
President
Minneapolis, MN
Dear Ms. Morris:
I am enthusiastic about the Director of People and Culture role at Borealis Philanthropy. I am
particularly drawn to Borealis' mission of advancing equity, inclusion, and community-driven
change, which aligns deeply with my personal and professional values. I have demonstrated
a passion for cultivating equitable, inclusive workplaces that foster belonging, trust, and
transformational change throughout my career. These values are central to Borealis
Philanthropy’s mission, and I believe my experience can help further this work.
My experience as Director of Operations at Strings Music Festival and previous roles in
nonprofit and government sectors have prepared me to make a meaningful impact in your
organization. I have led projects focusing on dismantling barriers to equity, ensured policy
and process alignment with the needs of marginalized communities, and maintained a
consultative and inclusive approach when collaborating with staff and community
stakeholders. Working closely with diverse teams, I have prioritized creating positive,
affirming spaces where all voices are heard and respected. This experience makes me eager
to work with a philanthropic intermediary committed to centering racial equity and the
intersections of class, gender identity, sexual orientation, and ability.
My own lived experience also profoundly aligns with the values at Borealis. As someone
whose family emigrated from Colombia and whose upbringing was enriched by cultural
diversity and resilience, I understand how vital intersectionality is to fostering true equity. For
instance, growing up, I witnessed firsthand the challenges my parents faced in navigating
systemic barriers, which has deeply influenced my commitment to equity and inclusion. I have
been shaped by my parents’ experiences, their strong connection to the community, and
their advocacy for opportunities despite facing systemic barriers. This perspective has fueled
my drive to contribute to organizations that honor and support individuals from historically
marginalized backgrounds.
In a national, remote startup environment, I would approach my work at Borealis by
intentionally focusing on empathy, transparency, and agility. In practice, I would meet
individually with each team member and affiliated stakeholders in the first 6 weeks in my role
to hear directly from them about priorities, challenges, needs, and hopes. Creating a valuesdriven
culture remotely requires exceptional communication and the ability to build authentic
relationships without relying on physical presence. I would leverage digital collaboration tools
to foster a strong sense of team cohesion and ensure that every employee feels engaged
and valued, regardless of their geographic location. The startup nature of Borealis also calls
for an adaptable, entrepreneurial mindset—qualities I’ve honed while leading initiatives in
evolving environments and developing programs from the ground up. My approach would
include a commitment to continual learning and openness to feedback while always putting
Borealis’ mission of racial equity and community care at the forefront of every decision.
Thank you for considering my application. I am very excited about the possibility of an
interview and look forward to the chance to discuss my qualifications further. I am eager to
bring my experience in organizational development, HR strategy, and cultural leadership to
Borealis Philanthropy. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team
and help shape a positive, values-driven workplace.

Reese Gadlin
District 8 Hiring Director
2900 S. College Ave
Fort Collins, CO 80525
Dear Mr. Reese Gadlin:
I am writing to express my interest in the Agency Manager position with Farmers Insurance.
While I have limited direct sales experience and lack specific licenses such as Property &
Casualty, Life & Health, and Insurance Producer, I am committed to obtaining these
certifications. My diverse background in operations, project management, and team
leadership makes me a strong candidate for this role.
Throughout my career, I have honed my leadership, process improvement, and relationship
management skills across multiple industries, including nonprofit, construction, and event
management. In my most recent role as Director of Operations at Strings Music Festival, I
oversaw large-scale projects, managed diverse teams, and cultivated strong relationships
with stakeholders to deliver a seamless customer experience. These experiences have
taught me the importance of building trust and tailoring my approach to meet clients' unique
needs—skills I believe translate well to a sales context.
Though my sales experience is limited, I have a proven ability to adapt quickly to new
challenges and environments. I have frequently taken on roles that required a start-up
mentality, where I had to build systems, teams, and processes from scratch. For instance,
while working with the BuildStrong Academy of Colorado, I led initiatives to integrate cuttingedge
technology into workforce training, pushing boundaries and demonstrating my knack
for seizing opportunities and driving growth.
My consultative approach, combined with my ability to motivate teams, adapt to changing
conditions, and understand customers' needs, will enable me to thrive as an Agency
Manager. Moreover, the comprehensive training provided by Farmers Insurance, especially in
the areas of licensing and sales skills, coupled with my willingness to learn, will bridge any
gaps in my sales experience and licensing requirements, helping me become an effective
and successful part of your team.

POSITION TITLE: PROGRAM SPECIALIST
AidKit
Hiring Team
Dear Hiring Team:
Throughout my career, I've had the honor of working with diverse communities, managing
operations, and delivering impactful programs to meet the needs of underserved
populations. From my experience with Habitat for Humanity, building affordable housing in
the US, Mexico, and Paraguay, to my recent roles focused on operations, program
management, and multi-stakeholder coordination in workforce development, I have seen
firsthand people's resilience when given equitable opportunities and the right support
systems. I am eager to bring this passion and dedication to AidKit as a Program Specialist.
AidKit's mission excites me because it is committed to empowering vulnerable populations—
including unhoused and unbanked communities—through innovative, efficient, and dignified
aid solutions. Reflecting on my past roles, particularly as Director of Operations at Strings
Music Festival, I can draw clear connections between my skills and AidKit’s vision, specifically
in managing multiple programs simultaneously and maintaining program standards. At
Strings, I led large-scale operational efforts, built effective systems from the ground up, and
ensured the seamless delivery of services to diverse stakeholders. This experience helped
me refine my skills in managing multiple programs and projects simultaneously and fortifying
my understanding of how building trust with my team and stakeholders, listening, and acting
in a way that respects their needs translates into genuine buy-in. As Director of Operations,
this buy-in enabled me to achieve high standards of excellence and ensure projects were
completed on time with unmatched quality.
My passion for serving marginalized communities extends back to my time as a Peace Corps
Volunteer, where I learned the importance of thinking globally and acting locally. During my
service, I managed a rural economic development program supported by my town's local
multi-faceted dairy cooperative. I worked with local farmers to optimize animal husbandry
practices, improve crop yields, and establish sustainable market channels, significantly
improving community livelihoods. Additionally, I played an integral role in launching a cash
and credit assistance initiative, which provided direct financial support to struggling farmers
that met specific criteria. This initiative allowed farmers to access essential resources during
economic hardship without taking the typical longer route, which often consumed precious
time during a growing season that demanded immediate action with narrow margins. This
initiative directly improved their resilience and ensured community stability among the
region's Paraguayan, Guaraní, and Mennonite communities. This experience fortified my skills
in managing multiple programs and projects simultaneously. It highlighted the value of
building trust with stakeholders, listening to their needs, and acting to foster genuine buy-in.
It is this same ethos that motivates me to join AidKit. I believe the Program Specialist position
will allow me to continue making a tangible difference—both by managing the operational
side of aid programs and by cultivating strong partnerships with clients and stakeholders.
At BuildStrong Academy of Colorado, I led efforts to integrate cutting-edge technology into
workforce training, challenging the status quo and demonstrating my commitment to pushing
boundaries for greater impact. Additionally, I oversaw budget planning and resource
allocation to ensure program sustainability and effectiveness. I developed robust data
collection systems that allowed us to derive more meaningful financial measures, such as the
cost per employed day (CPED), which provided a holistic view of our program's costeffectiveness
and value. Using these metrics, I made informed financial decisions that
optimized resource use and improved overall program performance. I am confident that my
approach to driving improvement and adaptability to new challenges will align well with
AidKit’s mission.
AidKit's work particularly inspires me because it addresses a fundamental need: ensuring aid
reaches those who need it most, quickly and with dignity. The challenges that come with this
work are complex, but my background has equipped me to navigate them with creativity,

POSITION TITLE: EXECUTIVE PROJECT COORDINATOR
Colorado State University
Division of University Operations
Mr. Brendan Hanlon
711 Oval Dr.
Fort Collins, CO 80521
Dear Mr. Hanlon,
I am writing to express my interest in the Executive Project Coordinator position at Colorado
State University. For more than 10 years, I have had the honor of serving some of the most
respected Colorado-based nonprofit institutions, contributing to their missions through
effective project leadership and operational excellence. With over a decade of experience in
operations management, project leadership, and strategic coordination, I am excited to
contribute to the Division of University Operations. My background aligns well with the
demands of this role, particularly in project management, workflow analysis, and executive
support.
Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working with diverse communities, leading
operations, and delivering impactful projects that improve people's lives. From my time with
BuildStrong Academy, where I managed the expansion into 10 new territories and generated
$1.25M in additional annual revenue, to my recent role as Director of Operations for Strings
Music Festival, where I led a $2 million remodel of a 650+ seat pavilion, I have seen firsthand
the power of effective operations and dedicated teamwork. These experiences have shaped
my passion for making a difference by building efficient systems and fostering collaboration.
I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to directly support the Vice President of University
Operations & CFO in his leadership and strategic initiatives. Having been in leadership
positions myself, I deeply understand what effective support looks like. I know how to
anticipate needs, provide reliable and well-researched insights, and ensure that complex
projects are managed with precision and efficiency. My strong analytical skills, experience in
data collection and summarization, and ability to synthesize insights into actionable
recommendations would be instrumental in supporting the Vice President’s strategic goals
and decision-making processes. I have a track record of preparing detailed status reports,
compiling critical background information, and ensuring that executives are fully equipped to
make informed decisions. In my previous roles, I implemented data tracking and project
management tools that allowed for efficient monitoring of project progress, financial
accuracy, and timely reporting to leadership. I am well-versed in managing executive retreats,
coordinating work sessions, and ensuring that all preparations and follow-up actions are
handled seamlessly, enabling leadership to focus on strategic priorities. I am confident in my
ability to coordinate effectively across teams, drive continuous improvement initiatives, and
ensure the smooth execution of diverse projects within CSU’s thriving community.
Beyond my technical skills, my career success has hinged on my ability to build and maintain
strong relationships, which I recognize as essential in supporting senior leadership
effectively. Whether working with senior executives, mentoring my direct reports, or
collaborating with vendors, I have always prioritized clear communication, trust, and mutual
respect. During my time in the Peace Corps, I managed a rural economic development
program that supported local farmers and communities, emphasizing the importance of
acting locally while thinking globally. This experience taught me how crucial it is to build trust
with stakeholders, listen to their needs, and foster genuine buy-in, which ultimately leads to
the successful completion of projects.
I am excited about the possibility of joining Colorado State University and directly
contributing to the leadership and strategic efforts of the Vice President of University
Operations. I am confident that my experience, dedication, and proactive approach to
supporting senior leadership will make a significant impact. I am ready to take on
responsibilities such as issue resolution, continuous process improvements, and ensuring
project efficiency, which are crucial to delivering effective outcomes. Thank you for
considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how I can
support your team.
Sincerely,
Roberto Hernández

POSITION TITLE: COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT MANAGER
Rosalie Kirkland
Colorado Department of Labor and Employment
Division of Employment & Training
333 M Avenue, Suite 300
Limon, CO 80828
Dear Ms. Kirkland:
I am excited to apply for the Community Engagement Manager position with the Colorado
Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE). With over 18 years of experience in workforce
development, program management, and community engagement, I have dedicated my
career to advancing economic opportunities for underserved populations. My expertise in
building strategic partnerships, leading outreach initiatives, and ensuring program integrity
aligns seamlessly with the responsibilities of this role.
Community Engagement & Relationship-Building
I have successfully established and nurtured multi-sector partnerships with community
organizations, businesses, educational institutions, and government agencies throughout my
career. As Community Engagement Manager and Small Business Consultant at the
Innovation Lab in Northeast Park Hill, Denver (2013-2016), I worked to empower working
families through economic advancement. Operating in a predominantly African American
neighborhood, I engaged community leaders, workforce organizations, faith-based
institutions, schools, and small businesses to build trust and foster collaboration.
As an Operations Manager at BuildStrong Academy, I expanded these efforts by leading
workforce development initiatives that connected justice-involved individuals, TANF
participants, and migrant workers to sustainable career pathways in construction. My ability to
cultivate strategic partnerships and develop customized training programs resulted in
increased employment outcomes and strengthened community impact.
Strategic Program Management & Workforce Development
At BuildStrong Academy, I developed and implemented strategic workforce training
programs that prepared individuals for high-demand careers. Managing a $765,000 grant, I
expanded programming to serve over 1,100 participants, ensuring compliance with federal
and state workforce development guidelines. My experience includes analyzing labor market
trends, designing targeted employment initiatives, and developing strategic plans to enhance
service delivery across rural communities.
Advocacy, Cultural Competency & Outreach
My deep understanding of rural workforce challenges, cultural dynamics, and employment
barriers has allowed me to tailor programs that meet the specific needs of targeted
populations. I have advocated for policies and funding allocations that directly support
veterans, individuals with disabilities, and communities of color. Additionally, I have delivered
public presentations and workshops to raise awareness about workforce opportunities,
successfully engaging stakeholders at both local and state levels.
Technology, Data Analysis & Performance Metrics
I leverage technology to track engagement metrics and assess program effectiveness and
am proficient in Microsoft Office Suite, CRM systems (Zoho, Salesforce), and virtual
engagement platforms. I have improved program efficiency, increased participation rates,
and enhanced service delivery by implementing data-driven decision-making.
I am eager to bring my strategic leadership, workforce development expertise, and passion
for community empowerment to CDLE. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my
background aligns with your mission to enhance employment opportunities across Colorado.
Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to your response.
Sincerely,
Roberto Hernández

POSITION TITLE: DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS
Colorado Poverty Law Center
Executive Director
Ms. Shannon MacKenzie
66 S. Logan St.
Denver, CO 80209
Dear Ms. MacKenzie,
I am writing to express my interest in the Director of Operations position at the Colorado
Poverty Law Project (CPLP). With over a decade of experience in nonprofit operations and a
deep commitment to housing justice, I am eager to contribute to CPLP’s mission of
improving access to legal services for low-income Coloradans.
My foray into housing advocacy began with my tenure at Austin Habitat for Humanity,
where I led a comprehensive homebuyer preparedness program serving a county of one
million residents. I implemented innovative policies to streamline our education programs,
ensuring greater access and efficiency without compromising quality. Collaborating with
diverse stakeholders, I fortified systems that helped countless families transition from
housing insecurity to stable homeownership.
At Mi Casa Resource Center, I played a pivotal role in coordinating the Business & Career
Legal Night, a program connecting clients with legal resources to address challenges
ranging from landlord disputes to contract issues. While my focus was small business
coaching, I witnessed firsthand how housing instability compounded my clients' struggles.
This experience deepened my understanding of the intersections between housing law,
economic opportunity, and social equity.
Additionally, my work as a contractor for Shaftel Law, providing translation and
interpretation services, has further enhanced my ability to bridge communication gaps and
connect vulnerable populations with critical legal resources. This role underscored my
commitment to ensuring equitable access to justice for underserved communities.
As with any nonprofit organization, my roles have consistently required much more than my
job title reflected. I have been responsible for HR policies, including their documentation,
implementation, and review, as well as developing performance evaluation infrastructure.
My duties also extended to facilities management, grant management, and financial
responsibilities equivalent to those of a bookkeeper. I’ve overseen IT infrastructure, from
procuring hardware and software to designing strategic three-year plans for IT
improvements and adoption among all personnel. These diverse responsibilities have honed
my ability to navigate the unique challenges of nonprofit operations and maintain seamless
workflows across multiple domains.
As Director of Operations at Strings Music Festival, I oversaw financial management, HR
functions, and organizational policy, driving efficiencies that supported program expansion.
My work ensured compliance with nonprofit fiscal policies, optimized resource allocation,
and nurtured a culture of accountability and collaboration—skills I am eager to bring to
CPLP.
What excites me most about this role is CPLP’s holistic approach to addressing housingrelated
legal challenges. I share your belief in the transformative power of advocacy and
education, and I am inspired by the opportunity to support CPLP’s vital work by streamlining
operations and enhancing organizational impact.
I would welcome the chance to discuss how my experience and skills align with CPLP’s
goals. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of
contributing to your dynamic team.
Sincerely,
Roberto Hernández
