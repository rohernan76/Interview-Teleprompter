# Tell Me About Yourself

I'm a strategic operations leader who thrives at the intersection of technical problem-solving and authentic relationship building. My career has been dedicated to creating systems that free up mission-driven organizations to focus on their impact rather than administrative burdens.

Most recently at Strings Music Festival, I directed operations for a major regional arts organization where I built custom automation tools that saved thousands in staff time while scaling our event capacity by 20%. What I'm particularly proud of was how these systems empowered our team members to spend less time on reconciliation paperwork and more time on creative programming.

Before that, I led operations for BuildStrong Academy, where I implemented unified data systems that increased participant engagement by 50% through improved training models. My work centered on creating operational frameworks that reflected the lived realities of our diverse community members.

Earlier in my career, I managed operations for an innovation lab in Northeast Park Hill, a historically Black neighborhood in Denver. This experience deeply shaped my approach to leadershipâ€”I learned that building community trust requires consistent presence, deep listening, and making space for others' leadership even when it challenges my own assumptions.

What draws me to The HadaNÃµu Collective is your precision in understanding the quiet burdens that weigh down nonprofits, especially those led by people of color. As someone who has experienced the unspoken code-switching and constant pressure to prove legitimacy that many leaders of color face, I'm passionate about creating operational systems that are both technically sound and culturally responsive.

I believe my combination of technical fluency and people-centered service aligns perfectly with this role. I don't just build systems for efficiency's sakeâ€”I design practical tools that actually make people's work easier and return time to the people doing mission-critical work. And I approach leader support with humility, asking the right questions rather than assuming I have all the answers.

I'm excited about the possibility of contributing to HNC's mission of helping nonprofits become more effective at what they do, particularly through the Infrastructure and Leader Support program where I can apply my experience in navigating complex systems so others don't have to.

# Application Q&A

Q1: What is most compelling to you about HNC or our approach?
What drew me most to HNC was how sharply it understands the quiet burdens that weigh down many nonprofitsâ€”especially those led by people of color. Too often, I've seen incredible leaders get buried in the daily grind of figuring out payroll systems, nonprofit registrations, or how to track impact in a way funders understand. These aren't side problems; they're mission blockers. What makes HNC stand out is the precision and humility in its approach: not offering a one-size-fits-all fix, but listening, customizing, and being hands-on with leaders to build systems that fit them. That kind of operational accompanimentâ€”grounded in both empathy and expertiseâ€”is rare. And for me, it's energizing.

Q2: Why do you believe you would be successful in this role?
I've spent nearly two decades in nonprofit operations, and what I bring isn't just technical know-howâ€”it's the instinct to innovate when it actually makes people's lives easier. At Strings Music Festival, for instance, I was responsible for reconciling monthly credit card statementsâ€”painstaking, manual work shared across six department heads. Using AI tools and Google Apps Script, I built a custom automation solution that reduced reconciliation time by two hours per head per monthâ€”roughly $6,200/year in saved labor, not to mention the mental load it freed up. I didn't build it for fun (though I enjoy this kind of tinkering); I built it because staff were drowning in inefficiency. That's the lens I bring to ops: find the friction, solve it, and return time to the people doing mission-critical work. HNC's approach to supporting leaders by removing operational barriers? That's exactly where I've spent my career thriving.

Q3: The majority of leaders HNC works with are executive leaders of color, and they often experience unique challenges and barriers as they work to bring their vision to life. Given this, please tell us a bit about why you're the right person to support leaders in navigating this complexity.
I've spent much of my career supporting leaders of colorâ€”and being one myself, I understand the unspoken code-switching, the resource gaps, and the constant pressure to prove legitimacy that many of us carry. When I led operations for the Innovation Lab in Northeast Park Hill, a historically Black neighborhood in Denver, I was a Latino nonprofit leader building community trust in a space where nonprofits had come and gone. It meant showing up consistently, listening more than talking, and making space for others' leadership even when it challenged my own assumptions. That experience taught me humility and how to support from behind the scenes. I don't assume I have the answersâ€”I ask the right questions, and I'm not afraid to roll up my sleeves to help leaders execute their vision on their own terms.

Q4: What is your superpower?
My superpower is purposeful innovation. I don't build flashy systems for the sake of looking modernâ€”I design practical tools that actually make people's work easier. At Strings Music Festival, I created an internal app that replaced two sprawling Google Sheets and a dozen headaches. It centralized 150+ events, streamlined scheduling, and brought everything into a mobile format that fit in people's pockets. I've transitioned entire orgs from paper-heavy workflows into clean, cloud-based ecosystemsâ€”like when I implemented Zoho One at BuildStrong to unify CRM, project management, and form systems. I was also an early adopter of AI tools (I started using ChatGPT Plus in late 2023) and now routinely build automations that cut down on busywork and increase accuracy. What drives me isn't the cool factorâ€”it's knowing that the time saved lets staff do the real work they were hired for. That's what I'm great at: building elegant fixes to messy problems.

Q5: What kind of workplace do you thrive in? What kind of workplace do you struggle in?
I thrive in workplaces that are collaborative, mission-driven, and grounded in mutual care. As a leader, I value team dynamics immenselyâ€”not just how work gets done, but how people show up for each other. Seeing someone bring their full human presenceâ€”their spark, humor, curiosityâ€”into a shared space matters to me. That's why I try to hold one-on-ones in person when I can. It gives me the chance to read between the lines, to ask things like: "Are you okay? Do you need help? Is your work still lighting you up? What drives you right nowâ€”professionally and personally?" In-person time doesn't need to be constant, but I believe it should be meaningful. And while I fully respect that much of today's work is remote and digital (and I won't try to reverse that tide), I also see it as an invitation to make each real-life interaction count. On the flip side, I struggle in workplaces that prioritize systems over people, or where culture is treated as a side project instead of the foundation. I do my best work in places where people trust one another, celebrate each other, and leave space for both rigor and joy.

# PAR Examples

## BuildStrong Academy

### PAR Example 1: Designing and Scaling Workforce Training Systems

**Problem:** 
As Director of Operations at BuildStrong Academy, I faced the challenge of scaling our workforce development program while maintaining quality and accessibility. Our training systems were largely paper-based, instructor-dependent, and difficult to replicate across locations. This created bottlenecks in enrollment, inconsistent training experiences, and limited our ability to track outcomes effectively. Additionally, we needed to better serve diverse participants, many of whom faced significant barriers to entering the construction industry.

**Action:**
I led a comprehensive redesign of our operational infrastructure:
- Implemented a unified CRM system with automated dashboards that centralized participant data, training progress, and employment outcomes
- Collaborated with instructors to develop standardized curriculum modules that maintained flexibility for different learning styles
- Led the integration of XR/VR tools into our training program, creating immersive learning experiences that improved skill retention
- Developed culturally responsive recruitment and support systems that addressed specific barriers faced by women and people of color
- Created strategic partnerships with employers and community organizations to strengthen our training-to-employment pipeline

**Result:**
The systems transformation yielded significant improvements:
- Increased annual participant engagement by 50% through improved training models and strategic education partnerships
- Boosted program completion rates from 68% to 85% by implementing responsive support systems
- Improved job placement rates by 35% through stronger employer partnerships and better-prepared graduates
- Successfully scaled the program model to multiple locations while maintaining consistent quality
- Significantly increased participation from underrepresented groups in construction (women increased from 12% to 28% of participants)

### PAR Example 2: Data-Driven Operational Leadership

**Problem:**
BuildStrong Academy lacked robust data infrastructure to inform decision-making and demonstrate program impact. Leadership had limited visibility into program performance, funders received inconsistent reporting, and we couldn't effectively identify improvement opportunities. This created challenges in securing additional funding and scaling our impact.

**Action:**
I spearheaded the development of a comprehensive data management strategy:
- Implemented a unified CRM system with automated dashboards that provided real-time insights into program performance
- Designed custom reporting templates that aligned with funder requirements while capturing meaningful impact metrics
- Trained staff on data collection protocols and created user-friendly interfaces that minimized administrative burden
- Established regular data review sessions with leadership to identify trends and improvement opportunities
- Developed participant feedback mechanisms that centered the voices of program participants in our improvement process

**Result:**
This data-driven approach transformed our operations and impact:
- Executive leadership gained clear visibility into program performance, enabling more strategic decision-making
- Secured a 40% increase in grant funding due to our ability to demonstrate measurable impact
- Identified and addressed specific program elements that were creating barriers for certain participant groups
- Reduced administrative time spent on reporting by 65% through automation
- Created a culture of continuous improvement based on data insights and participant feedback

### PAR Example 3: Fiscal Sponsorship Transition Management

**Problem:**
BuildStrong Academy was operating under fiscal sponsorship with the Colorado Nonprofit Development Center (CNDC), which provided essential administrative support but also created limitations for our growth and independence. We needed to transition to an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit while maintaining operational continuity, financial stability, and stakeholder confidence.

- Positioned the organization for accelerated growth, leading to a 40% expansion in program offerings within the following year

## Strings Music Festival

### PAR Example 1: Optimizing Year-Round Event Operations

**Problem:** 
When I joined Strings Music Festival as Director of Operations, the organization was struggling with inefficient event management processes. We managed 150+ annual events across multiple venues using a combination of spreadsheets, paper forms, and email chains. This fragmented approach led to scheduling conflicts, communication breakdowns between departments, and excessive administrative time spent on basic logistics. Staff were spending hours each week on manual data entry rather than focusing on artistic programming and audience experience.

**Action:**
I led a comprehensive overhaul of our event operations:
- Designed and implemented a centralized event management system that integrated scheduling, staffing, technical requirements, and venue logistics
- Introduced workflow automation using Google Apps Script to streamline team communication and task execution
- Created standardized processes for event setup, execution, and breakdown that could be consistently applied across venues
- Developed mobile-friendly digital tools that put critical information in staff members' pockets rather than in binders at the office
- Facilitated cross-departmental training to ensure all team members could effectively use the new systems

**Result:**
The operational transformation yielded significant improvements:
- Increased event capacity by 20% while simultaneously reducing operational costs by 15%
- Eliminated scheduling conflicts entirely and reduced last-minute logistical issues by 85%
- Saved staff approximately 15 hours per week in administrative time, allowing them to focus on audience experience
- Improved cross-departmental collaboration, with staff reporting higher job satisfaction and reduced stress
- Created scalable systems that allowed us to expand programming to new venues without proportional increases in administrative overhead

### PAR Example 2: Financial Process Automation and Efficiency

**Problem:**
Strings Music Festival's financial reconciliation process was labor-intensive and error-prone. Six department heads spent approximately two hours each month manually reconciling credit card statements, often with inconsistent coding and documentation. This created downstream challenges for accounting, delayed financial reporting, and diverted valuable leadership time from strategic priorities.

**Action:**
I identified this as an opportunity for purposeful innovation:
- Built a custom reconciliation app using AI and Google Apps Script that automated the matching of receipts to transactions
- Designed an intuitive interface that simplified expense categorization and approval workflows

**Result:**
This automation initiative delivered measurable impact:
- Reduced reconciliation time by two hours per department head per month, saving approximately $6,200 annually in labor costs
- Improved accuracy of financial coding, reducing accounting corrections by 90%
- Accelerated monthly financial closing process by 3-5 business days
- Increased compliance with documentation requirements from 75% to 98%
- Created a model for identifying and automating other administrative processes throughout the organization

### PAR Example 3: Complex Logistics Management Across Venues

**Problem:**
Strings Music Festival faced significant logistical challenges managing events across multiple venues with different technical requirements, staffing needs, and audience capacities. This complexity was compounded during our summer festival season when we hosted back-to-back events with quick turnarounds. Equipment was frequently misplaced, staffing allocations were inefficient, and setup times were inconsistent.

**Action:**
I developed a comprehensive logistics management system:
- Created detailed venue profiles with standardized setup configurations, equipment inventories, and staffing requirements
- Implemented a digital asset tracking system to monitor the location and status of key equipment

- Successfully managed a record number of events during our peak season with fewer logistical issues than previous years
- Received positive feedback from artists and technical staff about the improved organization and professionalism

### PAR Example 4: Vendor Relationship Management and Procurement Optimization

**Problem:**
At Strings Music Festival, our vendor management and procurement processes were decentralized and inefficient. Each department managed their own vendor relationships, resulting in duplicate vendors, inconsistent pricing, and missed opportunities for volume discounts. We lacked standardized procurement procedures, which led to unnecessary rush orders, higher costs, and occasional supply shortages that impacted event quality.

**Action:**
I implemented a strategic vendor management and procurement system:
- Conducted a comprehensive audit of all vendors and consolidated relationships where appropriate
- Negotiated improved terms with key suppliers based on our total organizational spend
- Developed a centralized vendor database with performance ratings, contact information, and contract terms
- Created standardized procurement procedures with appropriate approval workflows and lead times
- Implemented inventory management systems for frequently used supplies to prevent shortages

**Result:**
The new vendor and procurement approach delivered significant benefits:

- Decreased emergency orders by 75%, eliminating rush fees and reducing stress on staff
- Improved vendor performance and responsiveness through consistent relationship management
- Enhanced budget forecasting accuracy with better visibility into upcoming expenses
- Strengthened local community relationships by strategically supporting local vendors where possible

## USAID

### PAR Example 1: Navigating High-Stakes International Operations

**Problem:** 
As a Technical Trainer with USAID in Paraguay, I was tasked with supporting a critical rural development program that was facing significant operational challenges. The program involved multiple stakeholders with competing prioritiesâ€”local government officials, international donors, and community leadersâ€”each with different expectations and reporting requirements. Communication breakdowns were causing delays in project implementation, and donor confidence was beginning to waver.

**Action:**
I developed a streamlined operational framework that balanced stakeholder needs while maintaining program integrity:
- Created a unified reporting system that satisfied both USAID's rigorous documentation requirements and local partners' need for accessible information
- Established clear communication protocols for all stakeholders, including regular touchpoints and transparent decision-making processes
- Implemented a cultural bridge approach where I actively translated not just language but cultural contexts between international donors and local communities
- Facilitated collaborative problem-solving sessions that gave voice to local leaders while meeting donor requirements

**Result:**
The operational restructuring transformed program effectiveness:
- Program implementation timelines improved by 30%, with all key milestones met on schedule
- Stakeholder satisfaction increased across all groups, with particularly positive feedback from local community leaders who felt genuinely heard
- Donor confidence was restored, leading to continued funding for the initiative
- The operational framework I developed became a model for other USAID programs in the region
- Most importantly, the program was able to refocus on its core mission of rural development rather than administrative challenges

### PAR Example 2: Building Cross-Cultural Operational Systems

**Problem:**
In my role with the Peace Corps in Paraguay, I encountered a significant disconnect between how U.S.-based program administrators designed operational systems and the realities faced by local communities. Standard reporting templates and operational procedures often failed to account for local contexts, creating friction and reducing program effectiveness. This was particularly evident in our agricultural extension work, where rigid implementation guidelines clashed with seasonal farming practices.

**Action:**
I took initiative to redesign our operational approach:
- Conducted extensive listening sessions with local farmers and community leaders to understand their needs, constraints, and traditional practices
- Developed flexible operational frameworks that maintained accountability while respecting local rhythms and practices
- Created bilingual documentation systems that empowered local partners to take ownership of reporting
- Trained both U.S. volunteers and local counterparts on culturally responsive operational practices
- Advocated with senior leadership for systemic changes to program design that centered local knowledge

**Result:**
This culturally responsive approach yielded significant improvements:
- Program participation increased by 45% as local farmers saw their knowledge and practices respected
- Reporting compliance improved from 60% to 95% as local partners took ownership of documentation
- Sustainability of initiatives dramatically improved, with 80% of projects continuing after volunteer departure (compared to previous 40%)
- My approach was recognized by country leadership and incorporated into training for new volunteers
- The experience deeply shaped my understanding of how operational systems must reflect the lived realities of the communities they serve

# Supplemental Experience and Reflections

## Technical Background and Development Experience

My technical foundation was strengthened through formal education at CodeCraft School of Technology, where I completed Full Stack Web Development training in 2016. This experience gave me hands-on expertise with MEAN/JS development, enabling me to build custom applications and understand the technical architecture behind operational systems. This technical knowledge has been invaluable in my approach to operations, allowing me to bridge the gap between user needs and technical solutions.

I've consistently applied this technical expertise throughout my career. At BuildStrong Academy, I led the implementation of Zoho One as our unified CRM system, personally configuring custom modules, automated workflows, and reporting dashboards. This wasn't just a technical implementationâ€”I approached it as a cultural change management project, ensuring staff had the training and support needed to embrace the new systems.

My early adoption of AI tools (starting with ChatGPT Plus in late 2023) has allowed me to stay at the forefront of operational innovation. I now routinely build automations that reduce busywork and increase accuracy, always focusing on practical applications that solve real problems rather than implementing technology for its own sake.

## Financial Management and Reporting Experience

My experience with financial reporting extends beyond basic budgeting to include sophisticated financial management systems. I'm proficient in generating and analyzing key financial statements including Income Statements, Balance Sheets, and Cash Flow Statements. At BuildStrong Academy, I was responsible for managing a $765,000 grant, which required comprehensive financial reporting for funders and auditors while ensuring compliance with both federal and state regulations.

I've worked with various financial and accounting software, including QuickBooks, NetSuite, Microsoft Excel, and Zoho CRM for tracking financial metrics. My approach to financial management always balances rigorous compliance with user-friendly systems that don't create unnecessary administrative burden.

One of my strengths is conducting variance analyses to explain discrepancies between actual and forecasted expenditures, identifying areas for cost savings, and making recommendations to improve organizational financial health. These reports often combine financial metrics with operational data to give leadership a comprehensive view of program performance.

## Leadership Philosophy and Values

I am a thoughtful, values-driven leader who blends operational strategy with cultural empathyâ€”committed to building systems that serve both people and purpose. My leadership is grounded in several core values:

**Integrity & Respect:** I place strong emphasis on treating people with dignityâ€”whether it's a department head, a vendor, or a direct report. I believe respect fosters trust and operational excellence, and I lead with that mindset.

**Equity & Inclusion:** I'm intentional about making space for underrepresented voices, including my own as a first-generation, brown, Latino man. I value inclusive cultures and environments where everyone feels seen and respected.

**Community-Mindedness:** I care deeply about how my work connects to the broader communityâ€”whether it's advocating for bike infrastructure or building equitable workforce development systems.

**Authenticity:** I value storytelling, personal connection, and clarity over corporate jargon or fluff. I believe in bringing my full self to my work and creating space for others to do the same.

**Mission-Driven Leadership:** I'm motivated by purpose. The organizations I've worked with and the jobs I pursue are clearly aligned with values like access, sustainability, education, and community building.

**Operational Excellence with a Human Lens:** I'm not just focused on systems and performanceâ€”I'm committed to people-first operations. I consistently emphasize culture-building, team development, and thoughtful onboarding/offboarding.

## Training and Knowledge Transfer Approach

I have considerable experience in training and developing team members, particularly in process improvements and operational procedures. I appreciate the diversity in learning styles and tailor my teaching methods accordingly, adjusting not only the teaching materials but also the delivery methods to demonstrate my dedication to others' learning and success.

I've embraced innovative approaches to SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) creation, recognizing that not all SOPs are created equal. I've contributed to building intranet systems that house organizational SOPs, making them easily accessible regardless of the file management ecosystem in use.

I utilize workflow intelligence platforms like Tango for creating step-by-step guides that document processes in detail for those who need granular instructions. For visual learners, I use tools like Loom to record video tutorials that walk team members through processes in real-time, making complex procedures more accessible and easier to follow.

## Project Management and Prioritization

To manage multiple projects and deadlines effectively, I utilize a combination of project management software and organizational tools to maintain both granular and big-picture focus. I most often use Asana when collaborating with high-performing teams, allowing me to break down projects into tasks, assign responsibilities, and set deadlines.

For example, at BuildStrong Academy, I was responsible for overseeing a major construction upgrade while simultaneously managing the installation of EV chargers on campus. I used Asana to manage task assignments, track deadlines, and maintain communication across departments, ensuring both projects moved forward without delay.

In addition to digital tools, I incorporate 'on-desk ergonomic' organizers, such as Fluidstance's slope desk whiteboard and flow cards, to manage my time and priorities. These tools bring my attention to immediate critical needs while serving as visual reminders of long-term goals and project deliverables.

This combination of digital project management tools and physical organizers helps me keep track of multiple deadlines and maintain momentum, even when priorities shift. I credit this success to the systems I've developed, which allow me to stay organized, manage complexity, and keep projects on track.
