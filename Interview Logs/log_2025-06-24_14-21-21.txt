Q: Tell us why you want to work for REI as a REI Store Specialist.
A: I’m excited about the opportunity to work for REI as a Store Specialist because I deeply resonate with the company's mission to promote outdoor stewardship and community engagement. My passion for the outdoors aligns perfectly with REI’s commitment to helping people connect with nature. 

Throughout my career, I’ve focused on building authentic relationships and supporting diverse communities, which I believe is essential in a retail environment that values inclusivity and customer experience. I’m particularly drawn to REI's emphasis on empowering individuals, especially leaders of color, to navigate complexities and enhance their experiences in the outdoors. I see this role as a chance to leverage my background in operations and relationship building to contribute to a team that celebrates diversity and fosters a sense of belonging.

Moreover, I admire how REI prioritizes sustainability and environmental responsibility. I want to be part of an organization that not only sells products but also advocates for preserving the very spaces we love to explore. I’m eager to bring my experience in creating operational frameworks that reflect community needs and enhance engagement, ultimately ensuring that every customer leaves with a sense of connection to both the products and the planet.
