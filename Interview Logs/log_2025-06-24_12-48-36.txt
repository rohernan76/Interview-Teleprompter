Q: Why do you want to work for REI?
A: I'm drawn to REI because of its reputation as a company that is not only dedicated to the outdoors but also deeply committed to community and sustainability. REI's ethos of stewardship and outdoor advocacy resonates with my personal values of community-mindedness and respect for the environment. The company's focus on creating a culture where all are welcome to enjoy the beauty and peace of nature aligns with my dedication to equity and inclusion.

Furthermore, REI's cooperative model and focus on education and outdoor experiences are a testament to a collaborative and mission-driven workplace—one where employees and members alike are encouraged to engage and share in the collective passion for the outdoors. This mirrors my belief in the power of community and collective effort, which I've always strived to foster in my professional roles.

I see REI as a place where I can contribute to a meaningful mission while also growing personally and professionally. I am excited about the opportunity to work in a space that not only celebrates the outdoors but also actively works to make it accessible and sustainable for future generations. It's a perfect fit for someone like me who wants their work to reflect their values and make a positive impact on the world.
