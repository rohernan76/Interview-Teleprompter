Q: Why do you want to work for REI?
A: I want to work for REI because I see a profound alignment between my personal values and the core ethos of REI, which is about fostering a deep connection with the outdoors and building a community around that shared passion. REI's commitment to sustainability, stewardship, and education resonates with my own dedication to community-mindedness and authentic engagement. 

As someone who values integrity, respect, equity, and inclusion, I am drawn to REI's efforts to make the outdoors accessible to people from all walks of life, recognizing the barriers that exist for many communities. The company's initiatives to broaden the definition of what it means to lead an outdoor life, and to ensure that all people see themselves represented in the outdoor narrative, align with my commitment to creating inclusive spaces where everyone feels seen and respected.

Moreover, REI's business model as a member-owned co-op speaks to my belief in collaborative, mission-driven work environments. I appreciate how REI prioritizes the well-being of its members and employees, investing in their growth and fostering a culture where people support one another. This mirrors my approach to leadership and team dynamics, where mutual care is foundational.

In essence, working for REI would give me the opportunity to contribute to a company whose mission goes beyond profit, to one that invests in people, communities, and the planet. It's a platform where I can leverage my experience in operational systems and people-centered service to further enhance the experience of REI's members and support the company's admirable objectives in outdoor advocacy and environmental stewardship.

Q: What are your career plans in the next year or two?
A: In the next year or two, my career plans are focused on expanding my impact within the realm of operational leadership for mission-driven organizations. I aim to take on roles that allow me to leverage my experience in creating efficient, people-centered operational systems that amplify the effectiveness of organizations committed to social good.

I am particularly interested in opportunities that will challenge me to innovate and implement strategies that enhance organizational resilience and adaptabilityâ€”a necessity in our rapidly changing world. This includes embracing new technologies and practices that can streamline operations, reduce environmental impact, and increase accessibility and inclusion.

Further, I plan to deepen my expertise in strategic communication and data-driven decision-making to better support the teams I work with. By doing so, I hope to foster environments where collaboration and creativity can flourish, and where the values of the organization are lived out in its day-to-day operations.

Ultimately, my goal is to position myself as a leader who not only drives operational excellence but also contributes to the strategic vision of an organization, ensuring that we're not just doing things right, but we're doing the right things to make a meaningful difference in the communities we serve.
