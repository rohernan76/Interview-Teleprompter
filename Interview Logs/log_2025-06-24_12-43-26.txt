Q: Tell me about a time you had to deal with a tough customer.What motivates you in your career?
A: Certainly, I've encountered my fair share of challenging customer situations over the years. One instance that stands out was during my tenure at Strings Music Festival. We had a patron who was deeply dissatisfied with a change in programming—a last-minute substitution of artists due to unforeseen circumstances. This patron was a long-time supporter and their disappointment was palpable, which could have had broader implications for donor relations and community perception.

Approaching the situation, I employed active listening to fully understand their concerns. I acknowledged the disruption of their experience and empathized with their disappointment. Following that, I offered several alternatives, including exclusive access to a future event and a personal meeting with the artistic director. The key was to make the patron feel heard and valued, not just as a customer, but as an integral member of our community.

Through a respectful and personalized approach, we were able to not only resolve the issue but also strengthen the patron's loyalty to the festival. This experience reinforced the importance of integrity and respect in my interactions—values that are central to my professional ethos.

As for what motivates me in my career, it's the opportunity to create meaningful impact through operational excellence. I am driven by the challenge of finding innovative solutions to complex problems, particularly when it enhances the ability of organizations to serve their communities more effectively. The satisfaction of seeing a team or community thrive because of streamlined processes and systems I've implemented is incredibly rewarding. Moreover, the idea of fostering inclusive and equitable environments where everyone can excel propels me forward. I am passionate about leveraging my skills and experiences to contribute to a world where respect, equity, and community-mindedness aren't just ideals, but are woven into the fabric of how we operate day-to-day.
