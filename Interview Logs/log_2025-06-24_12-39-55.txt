Q: Why do you want to work for REI?
A: I'm drawn to REI because of its strong commitment to fostering a community that is deeply connected to the outdoors and to each other. The company's ethos of stewardship and passion for environmental conservation resonate with my own values of community-mindedness and respect for the natural world. At REI, I see an opportunity to contribute to a mission-driven organization that not only prioritizes the well-being of its members and employees but also actively works towards creating a sustainable future.

As someone who values integrity, equity, and inclusion, I appreciate REI's efforts to make the outdoors accessible and welcoming to people from all walks of life, including those who have historically been underrepresented in outdoor spaces. This aligns with my personal commitment to build inclusive cultures and environments where everyone feels seen and respected.

Moreover, REI's cooperative structure stands out to me as a model of collaborative and ethical business. It represents a way of operating that prioritizes the collective good and the long-term health of the community over short-term profits. That approach to business is something I not only admire but also seek to be a part of.

In essence, working for REI would allow me to merge my professional skills with my personal passions, enabling me to contribute to a company whose values mirror my own, while making a positive impact on the community and the environment.
