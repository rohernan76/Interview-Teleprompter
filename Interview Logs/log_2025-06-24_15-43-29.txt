Q: Why do you want to work at REI?
A: I want to work at REI because it truly embodies my passion for the outdoors and aligns with my values. As a cooperative, REI prioritizes community and environmental stewardship, which resonates with me deeply. I love that profits are reinvested into initiatives that make the outdoors accessible for everyone, not just a bottom line.

Being an avid rock climber, skier, and mountain biker, I see REI as more than just a retail store—it's a hub for outdoor enthusiasts. I want to be part of a team that inspires others to explore and enjoy nature while sharing my own experiences and knowledge. Working at REI would allow me to connect with like-minded individuals and contribute to a mission that I genuinely believe in.

Q: Tell me about your customer service philosophy
A: My customer service philosophy is rooted in genuine connection and understanding. I believe that effective customer service starts with active listening and empathy. When a customer approaches me, I make it a priority to acknowledge their concerns and truly understand their needs. For instance, if someone is frustrated with a product issue, I ask clarifying questions to get to the heart of the matter and work collaboratively to find a solution that aligns with REI's satisfaction guarantee. 

To me, good customer service is not just about selling gear; it's about supporting individuals on their unique outdoor journeys. I strive to listen first, then leverage my product knowledge to make recommendations that enhance their experiences. This approach reflects REI's commitment to fostering a community of outdoor enthusiasts, and it’s what drives my passion for this role. Ultimately, I want every customer to feel heard, valued, and excited about their next adventure.

Q: How would you handle a difficult customer?
A: When dealing with a difficult customer, my approach centers around active listening and empathy. I believe it’s essential to acknowledge their concerns right away. For instance, if a customer is upset about a product issue, I would first let them express their feelings without interruption, making sure they feel heard and valued.

Once I’ve listened, I would ask clarifying questions to fully understand the problem. This not only shows that I care but also helps me find the best possible solution together. I’d work within REI’s satisfaction guarantee to ensure they leave happy, whether that means processing a return, suggesting an alternative product, or simply providing them with more information.

Ultimately, my goal is to turn their negative experience into a positive one, reinforcing our commitment to customer service and the outdoor community. I want them to feel like they’re part of the REI family, and I’m here to support them.

Q: What's your experience with outdoor gear?
A: I have a deep passion for outdoor activities, which has driven me to stay current with outdoor gear trends through personal use and continuous learning. My hands-on experience includes rock climbing, skiing, and mountain biking, as well as daily bike commuting around Fort Collins. This active lifestyle gives me authentic insights into how gear performs in real-world conditions.

For example, when I’m climbing, I pay close attention to the nuances of different harnesses and shoes, which helps me understand what features are most important for different climbing styles. Similarly, my experience with various ski equipment allows me to recommend the right gear based on a customer’s skill level and the type of terrain they plan to tackle. I believe that this blend of personal passion and practical knowledge enables me to connect with customers and provide them with recommendations that truly enhance their outdoor adventures.
