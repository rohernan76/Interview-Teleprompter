Q: Why do you want to work for REI?
A: I'm drawn to REI because of its commitment to fostering a love for the outdoors and its dedication to sustainability and stewardship. As someone who deeply values community-mindedness and authenticity, I see a strong alignment between my personal values and REI's mission. The company's focus on creating a culture where everyone can thrive in the enjoyment of nature resonates with me, and I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to an organization that not only encourages outdoor adventures but also works to protect the natural environments we explore.

Moreover, as a leader who prioritizes equity and inclusion, I am impressed by REI's efforts to make the outdoors accessible to all, breaking down barriers that have historically kept diverse communities from fully participating in outdoor activities. I believe my experience in creating inclusive and equitable systems can further enhance REI's initiatives in this area.

Working for REI would allow me to merge my professional skills with my passion for the environment and social responsibility. I see this as an opportunity to be part of a team that is not just about selling products but is also actively engaged in building a community and a better world. That's the kind of purpose-driven work environment where I thrive, and I am confident that I can contribute meaningfully to REI's mission and goals.
