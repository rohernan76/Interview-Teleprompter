Q: Tell us a little about yourself.
A: Certainly! I’m a strategic operations leader with a passion for technical problem-solving and authentic relationship building. My career has been dedicated to empowering mission-driven organizations by creating systems that allow them to focus on their impact rather than getting bogged down by administrative tasks. 

Most recently, I directed operations at Strings Music Festival, a major regional arts organization, where I developed custom automation tools that saved thousands of staff hours and increased our event capacity by 20%. One of my proudest achievements there was designing systems that allowed our team to shift their focus from paperwork to more creative programming, ultimately enhancing our community’s cultural offerings.

What draws me to The HadaNõu Collective is your commitment to understanding the unique challenges faced by nonprofits, particularly those led by people of color. As someone who has navigated the complexities of code-switching and the need to prove legitimacy, I’m passionate about building operational systems that are not only technically sound but also culturally responsive. I believe my blend of technical fluency and a people-centered approach aligns well with this role. 

Before Strings, I led operations at BuildStrong Academy, where I implemented unified data systems that significantly boosted participant engagement. Earlier in my career, I managed operations for an innovation lab in Northeast Park Hill, a historically Black neighborhood in Denver, which taught me the importance of building community trust through consistent presence and deep listening. I’m excited about the opportunity to bring my experience and values to The HadaNõu Collective.
