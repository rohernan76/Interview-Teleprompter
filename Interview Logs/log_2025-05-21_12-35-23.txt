Q: Can you give an example of a system or process you created to improve team performance?
A: Certainly. While at BuildStrong Academy, I identified a critical need to improve our team's performance in delivering our workforce development program. Our training systems were predominantly paper-based and heavily reliant on individual instructors, which posed significant challenges for scaling and consistency.

I spearheaded the creation of a more unified and efficient operational infrastructure. This involved implementing a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system with automated dashboards, which provided real-time insights into our program's performance. This allowed our team to monitor participant progress and engagement more effectively and to make data-driven decisions.

Additionally, I collaborated closely with our instructors to develop standardized curriculum modules. This not only ensured a consistent learning experience across all locations but also empowered our instructors to focus on teaching rather than administrative tasks.

To further enhance the training experience, I championed the integration of Extended Reality (XR) and Virtual Reality (VR) tools into our program. These tools provided immersive learning experiences for our participants and allowed for practical, hands-on training in a controlled environment.

The result of these actions was a significant improvement in team performance. We saw a 50% increase in annual participant engagement, program completion rates jumped from 68% to 85%, and job placement rates improved by 35%. Additionally, we saw a substantial rise in participation from underrepresented groups in construction, which aligned with our commitment to inclusivity and accessibility.

Through these efforts, we not only optimized our team's effectiveness but also enriched the learning experience for our participants, setting them up for success in the construction industry.
