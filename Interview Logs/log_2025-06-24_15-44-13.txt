Q: Why REI?
A: I’m drawn to REI because it aligns perfectly with my passion for the outdoors and my values around community and stewardship. The cooperative model is incredibly unique; it’s inspiring to be part of an organization that prioritizes people and the planet over profit. I admire how REI invests directly back into the community and environmental initiatives, creating a culture that truly embodies the spirit of outdoor adventure.

As someone who bikes daily, climbs, and skis, I resonate with REI’s mission to inspire and educate others about the outdoors. I believe that everyone should have access to nature, and I appreciate REI's commitment to inclusivity and making the outdoors welcoming for all. Joining a team that is dedicated to fostering this connection and providing authentic expertise feels like the perfect opportunity for me to contribute my skills and passion while supporting a cause I deeply believe in.
