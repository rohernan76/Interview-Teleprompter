Q: How many years do you have working in customer service?
A: I have over two decades of experience working in roles that demand a high degree of customer service. While my primary focus has been in nonprofit operations, the essence of my work has always involved serving a customer baseâ€”whether it's internal stakeholders, community leaders, or the broader constituency of the nonprofits I've worked with. Building strong, service-oriented relationships and ensuring that their needs are met has been central throughout my career.
