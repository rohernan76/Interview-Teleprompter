Q: Tell me about a time you had to deal with a tough customer.
A: At Strings Music Festival, we faced a challenge with a long-time patron who was dissatisfied with changes to our seating arrangements, which we had updated to increase accessibility and safety. Understanding the patron's concerns stemmed from a deep appreciation for tradition, I scheduled a one-on-one meeting to listen and empathize with their perspective.

I explained the rationale behind the changes, emphasizing our commitment to inclusivity and the overall well-being of all attendees. To address their specific concerns, I offered alternative solutions that maintained the patron's experience without compromising our new policies.

The result was a win-win situation. The patron felt heard and continued their support for the festival, and we successfully upheld our improved seating arrangements. This experience reinforced the importance of balancing individual needs with community-oriented strategies, fostering an environment where everyone feels valued and respected.
