Q: What particular skills sets could you bring to our REI store here in Fort Collins?
A: Drawing from my diverse background in operations management and community engagement, I can bring a unique blend of skills to the REI store in Fort Collins. My experience has honed my ability to build and manage efficient operational systems, which I believe would be essential in ensuring that the store runs smoothly and effectively.

Firstly, my strategic planning skills would enable me to develop and implement operational processes that enhance customer experience while also maximizing staff productivity. Having launched and managed operations at the Innovation Lab, I understand the importance of creating an environment that is both welcoming and efficient, qualities I know align with REI's ethos.

Secondly, my community engagement experience has equipped me with the ability to build strong, authentic relationships. This skill is vital for connecting with local leaders and customers, understanding their needs, and fostering a sense of community around the store. My outreach initiatives in Northeast Park Hill involved training over a thousand individuals annually, demonstrating my capacity to engage with a diverse range of people and to provide them with meaningful support and services.

Moreover, my work in reducing overhead through streamlining service delivery systems by 35% has given me a strong foundation in cost management, which would be beneficial in managing the store's operations to meet financial targets without sacrificing customer satisfaction.

In addition, my experience in leading operations at Strings Music Festival and BuildStrong Academy has provided me with a strong background in working with leaders of color and supporting them through complex challenges. This skill set aligns well with the diversity and inclusivity values of REI, ensuring that all members of our team feel supported and empowered.

Lastly, my hands-on experience in problem-solving and providing efficient and effective support would be instrumental in quickly resolving operational issues that might arise, ensuring that our customers have a seamless shopping experience.

In summary, my skills in operations management, community engagement, relationship building, and strategic planning, combined with a proven track record of enhancing participant engagement and reducing operational costs, would be a valuable asset to the REI store in Fort Collins.

Q: Tell us a little about yourself.
A: Certainly. I'm a strategic operations leader who finds great fulfillment at the nexus of technical problem-solving and genuine relationship-building. My professional journey has been dedicated to architecting systems that alleviate administrative burdens, enabling mission-driven organizations to concentrate on their core impact. 

At Strings Music Festival, where I recently served as the Director of Operations, I had the opportunity to design custom automation tools. These tools were not only a technological triumph, saving thousands in staff hours, but they also expanded our event capacity by 20%. What truly gratifies me is the way these systems allowed our team members to redirect their energy from tedious paperwork to engaging in creative programming.

My approach to operations is deeply influenced by my experiences and the need for systems that are not just technically robust but also culturally attuned. This has been a guiding principle in my work, whether it was enhancing participant engagement at BuildStrong Academy through unified data systems or fostering community trust during my time managing operations in Northeast Park Hill. I'm proud of my ability to create operational frameworks that resonate with the diverse realities of the communities we serve.

Joining The HadaNõu Collective speaks to me on a personal and professional level. I am drawn to your commitment to understanding and lightening the often-overlooked burdens that nonprofits, particularly those led by people of color, bear. I see my role as not just an operational leader but as a facilitator of change, creating practical tools that empower people and enable them to dedicate more time to the mission-critical work they are passionate about.

Q: Why do you want to work for REI?
A: I want to work for REI because I see a strong alignment between my personal values and the ethos that REI embodies. REI's commitment to the outdoors goes beyond just selling products—it's about fostering a community and promoting a lifestyle that respects and cherishes our natural environment. This community-minded approach resonates deeply with me. 

Moreover, REI's dedication to sustainability and stewardship reflects my own passion for integrity and respect, not only towards people but also towards the planet. As a company that prioritizes equity and inclusion, I am drawn to REI's efforts to ensure that the outdoors is accessible and welcoming to all, regardless of background. This echoes my own commitment to creating inclusive spaces and advocating for underrepresented voices.

I am also impressed by REI's cooperative structure, which stands out in the retail industry. It's a model that values the input of its members and employees, fostering a collaborative culture that I thrive in. I want to be part of an organization where culture is foundational, not an afterthought, and where my work in creating operationally excellent systems can support a mission that I believe in—helping everyone experience the joy and benefits of the outdoors.

Finally, I am excited about the opportunity to bring my authentic self to work at REI, to contribute my story and perspective as a brown, Latino man, and to work in an environment that values authenticity and personal connection. I see REI as a place where I can grow, contribute, and align my professional skills with my passion for the outdoors and community service.
