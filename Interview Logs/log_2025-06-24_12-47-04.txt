Q: What particular skills sets could you bring to our REI store here in Fort Collins?
A: My skill set is deeply rooted in operations management, community engagement, and strategic development, all of which align with the values and goals of an REI store focused on serving outdoor enthusiasts. At the Innovation Lab in Northeast Park Hill, I honed my ability to create and manage efficient operational systems from the ground up, which would be invaluable in ensuring that your Fort Collins store runs smoothly and effectively.

I've demonstrated a keen eye for reducing overhead through streamlining service delivery, achieving a 35% reduction in operational costs in my previous role. This experience would directly contribute to managing the store's expenses and optimizing the use of resources to maximize profitability while maintaining high standards of customer service.

Furthermore, my experience with community-based entrepreneurship has equipped me with the skills to build strong, authentic relationships with both team members and customers. This aligns with REI's commitment to providing a great customer experience. I've worked closely with leaders, particularly leaders of color, to support them in navigating complex scenarios, which speaks to my ability to work one-on-one with diverse individuals and provide tailored support.

Also, my background in expanding outreach and engagement through strategic initiatives would be an asset in driving customer engagement and community involvement for the Fort Collins store. Whether it's through organizing local outdoor activities, educational workshops, or sustainability initiatives, I'm well-prepared to foster a sense of community among REI members and the broader public.

In summary, my skill set includes strong operational management, a track record of cost reduction, a commitment to community engagement, and a proven ability to build and maintain relationships—all of which would make me a valuable addition to your team at the REI store in Fort Collins.
