Q: Tell us a little about yourself.
A: Certainly. I'm a strategic operations leader with a passion for marrying technical problem-solving with genuine relationship building. Throughout my career, I've focused on developing systems that allow mission-driven organizations to concentrate on their societal impact rather than getting bogged down by administrative tasks. At Strings Music Festival, I had the opportunity to oversee operations for a significant regional arts organization. There, I crafted custom automation tools that not only saved substantial amounts in staff time but also increased our event capacity by 20%. 

What I take particular pride in is the way these systems enabled our team to dedicate more time to creative programming instead of being tied up with tedious reconciliation paperwork. My goal has always been to create operational frameworks that are not just efficient, but also culturally responsive and empowering for the people using them. This approach has been a cornerstone of my career progression, from improving participant engagement at BuildStrong Academy to fostering community trust in Northeast Park Hill.

I'm drawn to The HadaNõu Collective because of your commitment to understanding and lifting the burdens that nonprofit organizations, especially those led by people of color, often carry. I've personally navigated the challenges of code-switching and the pressure to prove legitimacy. This has fueled my dedication to designing systems that are technically robust and attuned to the cultural nuances of the communities they serve. I believe that my blend of technical expertise and people-focused service makes me a great fit for your organization, as I strive to create tools that not only streamline processes but also enrich the work-life of those making a difference.
