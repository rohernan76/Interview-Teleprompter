Q: What does great customer service look like to you? Describe a time when you received or experienced great customer service and what was the result.
A: To me, great customer service is about creating genuine connections with customers and really understanding their unique outdoor goals. It’s not just about making a sale; it’s about listening to their needs and using my product knowledge to enhance their adventures. 

One time, I was in a local outdoor store looking for a new hiking backpack. The associate approached me with a warm smile and asked about my hiking plans. Instead of just showing me what was on the shelf, they took the time to ask questions about the types of trails I enjoy, how long my hikes are, and what features I value most in a backpack. They listened intently and then recommended a few options, explaining the benefits of each based on my needs. 

What stood out to me was their genuine enthusiasm for the outdoors and their commitment to ensuring I found the perfect fit. I left the store feeling not only satisfied with my new backpack but also excited for my next hike. That experience reinforced my belief in the importance of connecting with customers and providing tailored recommendations. It’s moments like that that create loyal customers and inspire people to embrace the outdoors, which is what I aim to do at REI.

Q: Tell me about a time you were assigned a new and unfamiliar task. How did you approach the task and what were the results?
A: Absolutely! At AIBridgeGap.com, I was once tasked with leading a training session on a new product line that I wasn't very familiar with. Initially, I felt a bit overwhelmed, but I saw it as an opportunity to grow and support my team.

I started by diving into research—reading technical specifications and watching product demos to get a solid understanding of the features and benefits. I also reached out to colleagues who had experience with the products, gathering their insights and tips. Additionally, I scheduled hands-on time with the products to get a feel for them myself.

When it came time for the training, I integrated what I learned with real-life scenarios and customer feedback. This approach not only made the session engaging but also allowed my team to feel confident in their ability to sell the new products.

The results were fantastic! The team felt well-prepared and, as a result, we saw a noticeable increase in sales for that product line. It reinforced my belief in the power of collaboration and continuous learning, values that resonate deeply with me and align perfectly with REI’s cooperative spirit.

Q: Tell me about the experience you had managing the assignment to implement a brand new project management software at Strings Music in Steamboat Springs, CO and how I approached the task and what were the results.
A: At Strings Music, I was tasked with implementing a new project management software to enhance our team’s collaboration and efficiency. I approached this project by first gathering input from my colleagues to understand their needs and concerns. I believe in fostering a collaborative environment, and involving the team from the start ensured that we were all on board and invested in the change.

Next, I organized a series of training sessions to introduce the software’s features and functionalities. I aimed to make these sessions engaging and hands-on, allowing team members to practice using the software in real-time. This approach not only boosted their confidence but also ensured a smoother transition.

As a result, we saw a significant improvement in our workflow. The new software streamlined our project tracking, which led to a 20% increase in our overall project completion rate within the first few months. Team communication improved, reducing misunderstandings and enhancing our ability to meet deadlines. Ultimately, this project not only enhanced our operational efficiency but also strengthened our team dynamics, aligning perfectly with REI’s cooperative values of collaboration and shared success.
