Q: How many years of customer service experience do you have?
A: I have nearly two decades of experience in nonprofit operations, which has inherently involved a significant amount of customer service. Throughout my career, I’ve prioritized building strong, authentic relationships with leaders and stakeholders. For instance, while at Innovation Lab in Northeast Park Hill, I supported leaders of color by navigating complex operational challenges, ensuring they received the tailored support they needed. Additionally, my work at BuildStrong Academy, where I increased participant engagement by 50%, was all about understanding and responding to the needs of our community. So, while I may not have a specific number of years solely labeled as "customer service," my extensive experience in operations has been deeply rooted in providing exceptional service and support to those I work with.
