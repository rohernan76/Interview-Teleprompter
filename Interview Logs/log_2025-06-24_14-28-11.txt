Q: What are your career plans in the next year or two?
A: In the next year or two, I plan to continue building on my experience in operations and leadership within mission-driven organizations. My immediate goal is to leverage my skills in a role that allows me to further develop and implement systems that enhance operational efficiency while maintaining a strong focus on community engagement and impact.

I’m particularly interested in exploring opportunities that allow me to integrate my background in both the arts and education sectors. I believe there’s a significant opportunity to create innovative programs that not only enhance organizational performance but also foster deeper connections within the communities we serve.

Additionally, I aim to deepen my understanding of strategic communication within different contexts, ensuring that the narratives we share resonate authentically with diverse audiences. Ultimately, I want to continue to grow as a leader who prioritizes mission-driven work and cultivates environments where team members feel empowered to contribute their best ideas and efforts.
